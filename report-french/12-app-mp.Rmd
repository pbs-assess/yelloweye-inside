# DATA-LIMITED MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES {#app:mps}

Here we present the MPs that were evaluated in the current study. See @anderson2020gfmp for a full list of MPs available in the MP Framework.

## CONSTANT-CATCH MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES {#sec:mp-cc}

We evaluated three alternative constant-catch MPs: 

- CC_5t:  Constant annual catch of 5 t
- CC_10t: Constant annual catch of 10 t 
- CC_15t: Constant annual catch of 15 t

## INDEX-BASED MPs {#sec:mp-ibased}

### Index-ratio MPs {#sec:mp-iratio}

Index-ratio MPs base their TAC recommendation in year $y$ on last year's catch $C_{y-1}$ multiplied by the ratio of the average population index in a recent time period (e.g., the last two years) compared to the average population index in a previous short period. Therefore the reference population index is a moving window average.

The TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y = \alpha C_{y-1},
$$

where, for example,

$$
\alpha =
\left. \frac{I_{y-1} + I_{y-2}} {2} \middle/
\frac{I_{y-3} + I_{y-4} + I_{y-5}} {3} \right. ,
$$

where $\alpha$ is the ratio of the mean index in the most recent two years and the mean index in years 3--5 before the current year.

We evaluated two configurations of the index-ratio MPs, which differ in the time periods used to calculate $\alpha$, applied annually:

- Iratio_23:     ratio of the last 2 years to the previous 3 years

- Iratio_55:     ratio of the last 5 years to the previous 5 years

We also evaluated the same two configurations, applied every five years:

- Iratio_23_5u:  same as Iratio_23

- Iratio_55_5u:  same as Iratio_23

### Index-Slope MPs {#sec:mp-islope}

Index-slope MPs fit a linear regression of population index data compared to time and make a catch recommendation based on the slope of the regression. 
They are closely related to index-ratio MPs.
Here we describe three main "families" of index-slope MPs.

#### GB_slope: Geromont and Butterworth index slope {#sec:mp-gb-slope}

This MP adjusts TAC based on previous catch and the trend in a relative abundance index to aim for relatively stable catch rates [@geromont2015].
The TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y= C_{y-1}(1+\lambda \beta_I),
$$

where $C_{y-1}$ is catch from the previous year, $\beta_I$ is the slope of a linear regression of the ln abundance index over the last $n$ years (default of $n = 5$), and $\lambda$ is a control parameter between 0 and 1 that adjusts how quickly TAC is adjusted based on the slope of the index. The default $\lambda$ value is 1 in DLMtool.
The TAC is subject to the following conditions that limit the rate at which the TAC can be adjusted up or down:

- if next TAC > 1.2 last catch, then TAC = 1.2 $\times$ last catch
- if next TAC < 0.8 last catch, then TAC = 0.8 $\times$ last catch.

We evaluated three configurations of GB_slope, each applied annually:

- GB_slope_lambda1:   $\lambda = 1$	and  $\beta_I$ is calculated from index in the preceding 5 years

- GB_slope_lambda05:  $\lambda = 0.5$	and $\beta_I$ is calculated from the preceding 5 years 

- GB_slope_yrs10:     $\lambda = 1$	and  $\beta_I$ is calculated from the preceding 10 years

We also evaluated the same three configurations, applied every five years:

- GB_slope_lambda1_5u

- GB_slope_lambda05_5u

- GB_slope_yrs10_5u

Illustrations of the GB_slope MPs are provided in @anderson2020gfmp (their Appendix D)

#### Islope: Index slope tracking {#sec:mp-islope-track}

These MPs incrementally adjust the TAC in an attempt to maintain a constant relative abundance index.
The MPs are similar to "GB_slope" with the addition of a parameter that determines the TAC in the first projection year ($\textrm{TAC}^*$) and different choices of the $\lambda$ parameter.
The TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y = \textrm{TAC}^*(1+\lambda \beta_I),
$$

where, in the first projection year, $\textrm{TAC}^*$ is $(1-x)$ multiplied by the mean catch from the last 5 historical years.
We set $x=0$ for all configurations of the Islope MP.
In subsequent years, $\textrm{TAC}^*$ is the TAC from the previous year.
Again, $\lambda$ is a gain or smoothing parameter, and $\beta_I$ is the slope of the ln abundance index over the past $n$ years.

As for the GB_slope MPs, we evaluated three configurations of the Islope MPs, applied annually:

- Islope_10_lambda04:  $\lambda = 0.4$ and $\beta_I$ is calculated from the preceding 10 years

- Islope_10_lambda08:  $\lambda = 0.8$ and $\beta_I$ is calculated from the preceding 10 years

- Islope_5_lambda04:   $\lambda = 0.4$ and $\beta_I$ is calculated from index in the preceding 5 years

We also evaluated the same three configurations, applied every five years:

- Islope_10_lambda04_5u

- Islope_10_lambda08_5u

- Islope_5_lambda04_5u

Illustrations of the Islope MPs are provided in @anderson2020gfmp (their Appendix D)

#### IDX: Index-based MP from @cox2020 {#sec:mp-idx}

This MP was used in the rebuilding plan for Outside Yelloweye Rockfish in BC [@cox2020].
The MP assigns TAC based on:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y =
\begin{cases}
\textrm{TAC}_\textrm{Floor}, & \textrm{if}\ \Delta I_y \leq \delta_\textrm{min} \\
(1 + \Delta I_y ) \textrm{TAC}_{y-1}, & \textrm{if}\ \delta_\textrm{min} \lt \Delta I_y \leq \delta_\textrm{max} \\
(1 + \delta_\textrm{max}) \textrm{TAC}_{y-1}, & \textrm{if}\ \Delta I_y \gt \delta_\textrm{max},
\end{cases}
$$

where $\delta_\textrm{min}$ is the most negative drop allowed in the relative biomass index before the fishery is closed that year and $\Delta I_y$ is defined as:

$$
\Delta I_y = \frac{I_y}{I_{y-n}} - 1,
$$

where $I_y$ refers to a population index value in year $y$ and $n$ determines the reference year.
We set $\textrm{TAC}_\textrm{Floor} = 5 t$.
We set $\delta_\textrm{min} = -0.5$ as in @cox2020.
The maximum increase in TAC is capped at $\delta_\textrm{max} = 0.25$ by default.
This means that the TAC in any one year cannot increase by more than 25%, implementing a "slow up" behaviour of the MP.
The parameters $\delta_\textrm{min}$ and $\delta_\textrm{max}$ could possibly be additionally tuned to adjust the behaviour of the MP.

Note that the "slow-up--fast-down" behaviour determined by settings for $\delta_\textrm{min}$ and $\delta_\textrm{max}$, combined with the simulated survey index variability, can result in the MP "ratcheting" down the TAC despite an overall increasing index (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:proj-not-satisficed-eg)).
Furthermore, we implemented the MP exactly as described above and in @cox2020, which only uses $\textrm{TAC}_\textrm{Floor}$ if $\Delta I_y \leq \delta_\textrm{min}$.
This does *not* stop the TAC from slowly being lowered below $\textrm{TAC}_\textrm{Floor}$ by the "ramp" described by $(1 + \Delta I_y ) \textrm{TAC}_{y-1}$ if $\delta_\textrm{min} \lt \Delta I_y \leq \delta_\textrm{max}$ (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:proj-not-satisficed-eg)).

This MP can be additionally smoothed:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y = \lambda \cdot \textrm{TAC}_y + (1-\lambda) \textrm{TAC}_{y-1},
$$

where $\lambda$ controls the degree of smoothing and can range between 0 and 1. @cox2020 used $\lambda=0.5$.
We define these MPs for DLMtool as "IDX" ($\delta_{\textrm{min}} = -0.5$, $\delta_{\textrm{max}} = 0.25$) and "IDX_smooth" (same as IDX but with $\lambda = 0.5$ to split the difference between the upcoming proposed TAC and the one previously recommended).

We evaluated three configurations of the IDX MPs, applied annually:


- IDX                : IDX with $\Delta I_y = \frac{I_y}{I_{y-1}} -1$ 

- IDX_smooth         : IDX_smooth with $\Delta I_y = \frac{I_y}{I_{y-1}} -1$ 
  

- IDX_smooth_yrs5    : IDX with $\Delta I_y = \frac{I_y}{I_{y-5}} -1$

- IDX_yrs5           : IDX_smooth with $\Delta I_y = \frac{I_y}{I_{y-5}} -1$ 

We also evaluated the same four configurations, applied every five years:

- IDX_5u

- IDX_smooth_5u

- IDX_smooth_yrs5_5u

- IDX_yrs5_5u

Illustrations of the IDX MPs are provided in @anderson2020gfmp (their Appendix D).

## MODEL-BASED MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES {#sec:mp-model-based}

### Surplus Production Model {#sec:mp-sp}

In addition to the empirical MPs described above, we evaluated a surplus production (SP) model, paired with a harvest control rule as a model-based MP.
Here, we use the surplus production model implemented in MSEtool [@huynh_msetool_2019] and TMB [@tmb], based on @fletcher1978.
The SP model used in this framework is fully documented in @anderson2020gfmp (their Appendix D).
Note that the SP model uses all available indices in the historical period, but only the HBLL survey in the projection period.

We paired the model with two ramped harvest control rules (Figure \@ref(fig:mp-hcrs)):

1. HCR-8040: Above 80% of $\hat{B}/\hat{B}_\textrm{MSY}$, $F_y = \hat{F}_\textrm{MSY}$; at or below 40% of estimated $\hat{B}/\hat{B}_\textrm{MSY}$, $F_y = 0$; between 40% and 80%, interpolate the adjustment factor linearly.
Note that the hat notation indicates the reference point was estimated in the SP MP. 
This HCR creates operational control points that mimic the provisional biological upper stock reference and limit reference points from DFO's Sustainable Fisheries Framework (Figure \@ref(fig:pa-illustration)), where operational control points define the thresholds of management action (i.e., reducing fishing mortality).

2. HCR-4010: Above 40% of estimated $\hat{B}/\hat{B}_0$ (biomass divided by unfished equilibrium spawning biomass), $F_y = \hat{F}_\textrm{MSY}$; at 10% of estimated $\hat{B}/\hat{B}_0$, $F_y = 0$; between 10% and 40%, interpolate the adjustment factor linearly.
This is a commonly applied HCR in the fisheries literature and on the US West Coast [e.g., @berger_2019].
Note that this reference point is based on MP estimates of *B*~0~, whereas HCR-8040 is based on *B*~MSY~.

We evaluated two configurations of the SP model MPs, applied every five years:

- SP_8040_5u: SP model paired with HCR-8040

- SP_4010_5u: SP model paired with HCR-4010

We also evaluated the same two configurations, applied every 10 years:

- SP_4010_10u

- SP_8040_10u
