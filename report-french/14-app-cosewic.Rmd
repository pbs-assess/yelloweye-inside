# COSEWIC CONSIDERATIONS {#app:cosewic}

The Inside Yelloweye Rockfish stock is also listed under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) as a Species of Special Concern [@cosewic2008], and is anticipated to be reassessed by COSEWIC in 2020.
COSEWIC and DFO have different criteria for assessing the status of marine fish stocks.
DFO focuses on current status relative to some reference state or threshold, while COSEWIC criteria (based on IUCN Red List categories) are focused on the probability of decline over past generations and the probability of continued declines in the future [@cosewic2015].
COSEWIC applies a set of quantitative assessment criteria and guidelines to develop and assign a status to the stock in question.
To inform the reassessment of Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, we report results for two of COSEWIC's quantitative assessment criteria that may be applicable to this stock, Metric A and Metric E.

## COSEWIC METRIC A

COSEWIC Metric A measures the probability that the stock has declined by 70%, 50% and 30% after three generations, where one generation for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish is defined as 38 years.
Note that three generations under this definition is 114 years but since our historical period (1918-2019) is 102 years, we use this as an approximation of three generations.
These probability thresholds are used to assign status designations of endangered, threatened, and species of special concern respectively, although other factors, such as cause of decline, are also considered [@cosewic2015].
To inform the COSEWIC re-assessment of Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, we report the following for each OM (Figure \@ref(fig:cosewic-metrics)):

1. P70 - Probability that, on average, the stock declined below 70% of *B*~1918~ over three generations, where generation time is 38 years and probability is calculated as $P[1 - B_{2019}/B_{1918} > 0.7]$.
2. P50 - Probability that, on average,  the stock declined below 50% of *B*~1918~ over three generations.
3. P30 - Probability that, on average,  the stock declined below 30% of *B*~1918~ over three generations.

Results for COSEWIC metric A, the probability that the stock was on average below 70%, 50%, and 30% of *B*~1918~ over the past three generations, for each OM scenario, where one generation is defined as 38 years.

## EXTINCTION RISK - COSEWIC METRIC E

COSEWIC Metric E measures the probability of future extinction of the stock.
A stock is designated as endangered if the probability of extinction is 20% within 20 years (or five generations, whichever is longer) and threatened if there is a 10% probability of extinction within 10 years.
Criteria E is seldom applied to marine fishes, due to heavy reliance on data, and assumptions about parameters required as inputs to population viability analyses (Ross Claytor, COSEWIC, pers.comm, January 29, 2020).
Another requirement for estimating extinction risk involves setting the threshold for extinction, which is not explicitly defined in the COSEWIC criteria [@cosewic2015].  

In order to evaluate the probability of future extinction under candidate MPs, stock-specific extinction thresholds must be assigned.
Below these thresholds the stock would be considered functionally extirpated or extinct.
We propose two candidate extinction thresholds of 2%*B*~0~ and 5%*B*~0~.
These arbitrary thresholds were informed by precedents in the literature [e.g., @forrest2015 used 5%*B*~0~] and historical depletion estimates for other species in the Strait of Georgia e.g., Lingcod in the Strait of Georgia have been estimated to be depleted to as low as 2%*B*~0~ but are recovering [@logan2005]. 
In the future, simulation-testing of alternative thresholds could be used to identify stock-specific extinction thresholds.

Using a projection period of 100 years, we calculated the probability that, on average throughout the whole 100 year projection period, the stock remains above 2% and 5% *B*~0~ under the five satisficed MPs and the no fishing reference MP for each OM scenario individually (Figure \@ref(fig:cosewic-all)).
We also calculated the average probability that the stock remains above each threshold under these MPs across all OM reference set scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:cosewic-avg)):

1. 2%B~0~ = $P[B_y > 0.02 B_0]$ on average during the whole projection period
2. 5%B~0~ = $[B_y > 0.05 B_0]$ on average during the whole projection period

The results of this analysis show that there is a very low risk of extinction under the satisficed MPs, using these thresholds.
