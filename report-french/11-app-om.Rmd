# INSIDE YELLOWEYE ROCKFISH OPERATING MODEL DEFINITION {#app:desc-om-yelloweye}

Here we describe the specification of the initial OM before conditioning with the SRA model.
The operating model is fully described in Appendix A of @anderson2020gfmp.
We use a convenience function `display_om()` to display the contents of various parameters in the OMs.
The object `oms` is a list of the operating models across the various OM scenarios.
If a given "slot" or OM parameter is entered as a single value then `display_om()` outputs a single value.
Where a range of values is displayed, this represents the lower and upper boundaries of a uniform distribution.
Where a "slot" or OM parameter is defined based on a stochastic distribution other than a uniform distribution, we demonstrate the sampling from that distribution along with the stochastic seed used to generate consistent samples.

## STOCK SLOT DESCRIPTIONS {#app:desc-stock-yelloweye}

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### maxage {#app:desc-stock-maxage-yelloweye}

*The maximum age of individuals that is simulated.*

The maximum observed age of Inside Yelloweye Rockfish is 101 *y* [@databases2019].
Here we set a maximum age of 80 *y*, noting that the maximum age class is treated as a plus group once the OM is conditioned by the SRA [@anderson2020gfmp].

```{r desc-stock-maxage-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "maxage")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### M {#app:desc-stock-m-yelloweye}

*Natural mortality rate.*

The rate of natural mortality *M* is a core uncertainty for this stock, as for many stocks. 
We incorporated uncertainty using a Monte Carlo approach, by sampling *M* from a prior probability distribution based on that used by @yamanaka2011, where $M \sim \textrm{Lognormal}(0.045, 0.2)$ (with the seed in R set to 91283).
This was based on the Hoenig equation [@hoenig1983] using an assumed maximum age of 101 years.
The exception was OM Scenario (A), which used the distribution $M \sim \textrm{Lognormal}(0.025, 0.2)$.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# pseudo code:
set.seed(91283)
OM@cpars$M <- rlnorm(nsim, log(0.045) - 0.5 * 0.2^2, 0.2)

set.seed(91283)
OM_Scenario_A@cpars$M <- rlnorm(nsim, log(0.025) - 0.5 * 0.2^2, 0.2)
```

```{r desc-stock-m-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo, fig.cap="Distributions of natural mortality (\\emph{M}) used in the OM scenarios. All OMs used the same distributions except \"(A) Low M\"."}
display_om(oms, "M")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### h {#app:desc-stock-h-yelloweye}

*Steepness of the stock-recruit relationship.*

Steepness (*h*) is another core uncertainty for most stocks. We incorporated uncertainty using a Monte Carlo approach, by sampling *h* from a prior probability distribution based on that published by @forrest2010 and used in @yamanaka2011, where $X \sim \textrm{Beta}(\alpha = 9.6, \beta = 5.5)$, which was then transformed to $h = 0.8 X + 0.2$.
The values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ were selected to give mean *h* = 0.71 and standard deviation 0.1. While the standard deviation of 0.1 is lower than the value of 0.15 given in @yamanaka2011, a larger standard deviation is more likely to generate lower values of *h* with *F*~MSY~ < 0.01, which seemed implausible. The value of 0.1 still gave steepness values between 0.5--0.9, which appeared to be a sufficiently wide range of coverage.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
alphaconv <- function(m, sd) m * (((m * (1 - m)) / (sd^2)) - 1)
betaconv <- function(m, sd) (1 - m) * (((m * (1 - m)) / (sd^2)) - 1)

h_alpha <- alphaconv((0.71 - 0.2), 0.12)
h_beta <- betaconv((0.71 - 0.2), 0.12)
set.seed(65423)
h_samps <- 0.8 * rbeta(nsim, h_alpha, h_beta) + 0.2
mean(h_samps) %>% round(2)
sd(h_samps) %>% round(2)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
OM@cpars$h <- h_samps
```

```{r desc-stock-h-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo, fig.cap="Distributions of steepness (\\emph{h}) used in the OM scenarios. All OMs used the same \\emph{h} samples."}
display_om(oms, "h")
```

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Perr {#app:desc-stock-perr-yelloweye}

*Process error, the CV of lognormal recruitment deviations.*

We used a value of 0.4, as estimated in the base model for the Outside Yelloweye Rockfish rebuilding plan [@cox2020].
```{r desc-stock-perr-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "Perr")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Linf {#app:desc-stock-linf-yelloweye}

*Mean asymptotic length.*

This value was estimated from length and age data from the survey data collected in Area 4B (see Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
This parameter was estimated for both males and females combined, as no sexual dimorphism has been observed for this stock.

```{r desc-stock-linf-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "Linf")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### K {#app:desc-stock-k-yelloweye}

*von Bertalanffy growth parameter.*


This value was estimated from length and age data from the survey data collected in Area 4B (see Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
This parameter was estimated for both males and females combined, as no sexual dimorphism has been observed for this stock.


```{r desc-stock-k-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "K")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### t0 {#app:desc-stock-t0-yelloweye}

*von Bertalanffy theoretical age at length zero.*


This value was estimated from length and age data from the survey data collected in Area 4B (see Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
This parameter was estimated for both males and females combined, as no sexual dimorphism has been observed for this stock.


```{r desc-stock-t0-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "t0")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Maturity {#app:desc-stock-maturity-yelloweye}

*Maturity ogive.*

Maturity was directly input as an age-based function.
Therefore the default DLMtool slots `L50` and `L50_95` were not used.
Female maturity-at-age was estimated using maturity and age data from the survey data collected in Area 4B (Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
The minimum observed age of maturity was seven years and it assumed that younger ages were all immature.

```{r desc-stock-maturity, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
create_maturity_ogive <- function(A50, A95, maxage, Amin) {
  ages <- 1:maxage
  mat_age <- 1/(1 + exp(log(19) * (ages - A50)/(A95 - A50)))
  return(ifelse(ages < Amin, 0, Amin, mat_age))
}
OM@cpars$Mat_age <- create_maturity_ogive(14.4, 27.4, OM@maxage, 7) %>% 
  array(OM@maxage, OM@nyears + OM@proyears, OM@nsim) %>% aperm(c(3, 1, 2))
```

<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### a {#app:desc-stock-a-yelloweye}

*Length-weight parameter alpha.*

This value was estimated from length and weight data from the survey data collected in Area 4B (see Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
This parameter was estimated for both males and females combined, as no sexual dimorphism has been observed for this stock.

```{r desc-stock-a-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "a")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### b {#app:desc-stock-b-yelloweye}

*Length-weight parameter beta. Positive real number.*

This value was estimated from length and weight data from the survey data collected in Area 4B (see Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
This parameter was estimated for both males and females combined, as no sexual dimorphism has been observed for this stock.

```{r desc-stock-b-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "b")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

## FLEET SLOT DESCRIPTIONS {#app:desc-fleet-yelloweye}

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### CurrentYr {#app:desc-fleet-currentyr-yelloweye}

*The current calendar year (final year) of the historical simulations ($t_c$).*

```{r desc-fleet-currentyr-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "CurrentYr")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### nyears {#app:desc-fleet-nyears-yelloweye}

*The number of years for the historical period.*

The time series of historical catch data $t_1 = 1918$ to $t_c = 2019$ was used to define the historical period of the operating model.
 
```{r desc-fleet-nyears-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "nyears")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->


<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Selectivity {#app:desc-fleet-selectivity-yelloweye}

Selectivities for all commercial and survey fleets were directly input as age-based logistic functions in the SRA model.
Therefore the default DLMtool slots describing selectivity-at-length were not used.

Selectivity-at-age in the HBLL survey was set to give 5% selectivity at 6.8 *y* and full selectivity at age = 22 *y*, in all OM scenarios except Scenario (4), where selectivity-at-age was estimated using available age-composition data (Figure \@ref(fig:HBLL-selectivity)).
Due to large uncertainties in selectivity-at-age in the Dogfish survey, selectivity in this survey was set to mirror selectivity in the HBLL survey.

(ref:fig-HBLL-selectivity) Selectivity-at-age for the HBLL survey, which was fixed for all OM scenarios except Scenario (4). Note that selectivity in the Dogfish Survey was set to mirror the selectivity in the HBLL survey within simulation replicates.

```{r HBLL-selectivity, fig.cap="(ref:fig-HBLL-selectivity)", out.width="6.3in"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("mse/figures/HBLL-selectivity.png"))
```

Selectivities-at-age in the recreational and commercial fleets were based on the values used in @cox2020 (Figure \@ref(fig:sra-selectivity)).
Commercial and recreational selectivity was fixed in the SRA model, for all OM scenarios.
For the recreational fleet, the age-at-50% and 95% selectivity was 6.7 *y* and 11.5 *y*, respectively.
For the commercial hook and line fleet, the age-at-50% and 95% selectivity was 14.4 *y* and 21 *y*, respectively.

(ref:fig-sel-fleet) Selectivities-at-age used in the SRA model for the recreational and commercial fleets.

```{r sra-selectivity, fig.cap="(ref:fig-sel-fleet)", out.width="3.8in"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("mse/figures/fishery-selectivity2.png"))
```

For the projection period ($t > t_c$), the DLMtool OM only accommodates one fishing fleet.
In analyses with more than one fishing fleet, selectivity-at-age is passed from the SRA back to the DLMtool OM as an average catch-weighted selectivity function, based on normalized SRA estimates of relative fishing mortality by age and year $F_{a,y}$ (see Appendix A of @anderson2020gfmp).
The closed-loop simulation projections assume that the relative selectivities across fleets remains constant, as estimated by the SRA in the final historical year($t_c$) (Figure \@ref(fig:om-selectivity)).

(ref:fig-om-sel) Selectivity-at-age in years $t \geq t_c$ for the combined commercial and recreational fleets in the OM projections.

```{r om-selectivity, fig.cap="(ref:fig-om-sel)", out.width="4.5in"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("mse/figures/fishery-selectivity-terminal-year.png"))

## OBS SLOT DESCRIPTIONS {#app:desc-obs-yelloweye}

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Cobs {#app:desc-obs-cobs-yelloweye}

*Observation error in the catch expressed as a SD.*

This parameter ($\sigma_C$) sets the standard deviation of the simulated catch for the projection period. The DLMtool operating model can generate $\sigma_C$ based on the residuals between the predicted and observed catch. Since the SRA model conditions the OM on observed catch, the predicted catch will match the observed catch and thus, $\sigma_C < 0.01$.

<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Cbias {#app:desc-obs-cbias-yelloweye}

*Bias in the catch.*

This parameter controls the bias, expressed as the ratio of simulated observed to true catches, i.e. under/overreporting, for the projection period. The DLMtool operating model can estimate the bias parameter as the ratio of mean observed and mean predicted catch. Since the SRA model conditions the OM on observed catch, the ratio is 1.

<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Iobs {#app:desc-obs-iobs-yelloweye}

*Observation error in the relative abundance indices expressed as a SD.*

This parameter ($\sigma_I$) sets the standard deviation in simulated survey indices for the projection period.
We set $\sigma_I = 0.25$, based on the standard deviation of the observed HBLL index for all OM scenarios except Scenario (B), where $\sigma_I$ was set based on the standard deviation and autocorrelation from the index residuals in OM Scenario (1) (see Section \@ref(sec:approach3-referenceB)).

<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### beta {#app:desc-obs-beta-yelloweye}

*A parameter controlling hyperstability/hyperdepletion where values below 1 lead to hyperstability (an index that decreases more slowly than true abundance) and values above 1 lead to hyperdepletion (an index that decreases more rapidly than true abundance). Uniform distribution*

We set the hyperstability/hyperdepletion parameter $\beta = 1$  to imply no hyperstability or hyperdepletion.

<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

## IMP SLOT DESCRIPTIONS {#app:desc-imp-yelloweye}

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### TACFrac {#app:desc-imp-tacfrac-yelloweye}

*Mean fraction of TAC taken. Uniform distribution.*

We assumed no implementation error.

display_om(oms, "TACFrac")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

### TACSD {#app:desc-imp-tacsd-yelloweye}

*Log-normal CV in the fraction of TAC taken. Uniform distribution.*

We assumed no implementation error.
