# INTRODUCTION {#sec:introduction}

The purpose of this project is to provide scientific advice to support revision of the rebuilding plan for the inside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish (*Sebastes ruberrimus*)[@ifmp2018], consistent with national policy guidance [@dfo2009; @dfo2013]. 
The project applies a closed-loop simulation framework [@anderson2020gfmp] to evaluate the performance of alternative management procedures (MPs) with respect to rebuilding objectives for the inside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish (hereafter Inside Yelloweye Rockfish).

## MOTIVATION: POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE OBLIGATIONS {#sec:introduction-motivation}

The Canadian Sustainable Fisheries Framework (SFF) lays the foundation for the precautionary approach (PA) to fisheries management in Canada [@dfo2006; @dfo2009].
The PA Framework [@dfo2009] relies on the definition of biological reference points (BRPs), which define biomass targets and low biomass thresholds that are to be avoided with high probability.
The approach requires that fishing mortality be adjusted in relation to two levels of stock status---an Upper Stock Reference (USR) and a Limit Reference Point (LRP) (Figure \@ref(fig:pa-illustration)).
The LRP and USR delineate three stock status zones ("critical", "cautious", and "healthy").

Canadian fish stocks that have been assessed as being below the LRP, i.e., in the critical zone [@dfo2009], require a rebuilding plan to grow the stock above the LRP [@dfo2013].

```

In June 2019, major amendments to Canada's *Fisheries Act* legislated many key components of the SFF, which are encoded in the Fish Stocks provisions ([Section 6 of the *Fisheries Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-14/page-3.html#h-1175547)).
The Fish Stocks provisions require that major stocks be managed at sustainable levels, specifically at biomass levels above the LRP.
Furthermore,  Section 6.2(1) of the provisions states that if a major fish stock has declined below its LRP, a rebuilding plan shall be established to rebuild the stock above the LRP.
Major fish stocks will be designated under regulations, with the first batch of stocks due to be designated in the fall of 2020.

The guidance for the development of rebuilding plans in Canada [@dfo2013] states that rebuilding plans should be based upon objectives characterised by:

1. A target.
2. A desired time to reach the target.
3. An agreed-upon acceptable probability of reaching the target.

Rebuilding plans should also include planned management measures (i.e., MPs), milestone objectives, and should undergo regular performance reviews (every three years), in addition to annual monitoring and evaluation. 
Current guidance states that the timelines for rebuilding should be 1.5 to 2 times the generation time of the species [@dfo2013], where generation time is the average number of years between the birth of an individual and the birth of its offspring.

## BACKGROUND {#sec:introduction-background}

Inside Yelloweye Rockfish occur in Groundfish Management Area 4B in British Columbia (BC) (Figure \@ref(fig:map-4B)).
The stock is expected to be designated as a major fish stock in the fall of 2020, at which time its management will be legislated under the Fish Stocks provisions.
The stock was assessed as being below the LRP in 2010 [@yamanaka2011; @dfo2012].
In response, a rebuilding plan was developed and published in Appendix 9 of the Pacific Region Integrated Fishery Management Plan (IFMP) for Groundfish [@ifmp2018].
The Inside Yelloweye stock is also listed under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) as a Species of Special Concern [@cosewic2008], and is anticipated to be reassessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2020.
Results from this project may inform the COSEWIC reassessment and, potentially, a SARA Recovery Potential Assessment, should one be required (see Appendix \@ref(app:cosewic)).

```

The current rebuilding plan objective is to "rebuild the stock above the LRP over 80 years with 56% probability of success".
The milestone objective is to "achieve positive trends within each 10 year period".
The current MP for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish aims to keep the total annual catch (commercial, recreational, First Nations food, social and ceremonial (FSC), and survey) below 15 tonnes (see Appendix 9 of @ifmp2018 for details).

The guidance for rebuilding plans in Canada states that there should be a high probability of rebuilding fish stocks out of the critical zone within the stated time-frame [@dfo2013].
Part of the motivation for this project was concern, expressed by fisheries managers, that the 56% probability of success stated in the current rebuilding plan [@ifmp2018] is inconsistent with the definition of high probability.

The guidance document also identifies some recommended management measures, which include: keeping removals from all sources to the lowest possible level; development of a harvest control rule (HCR); and application of management strategy evaluation (MSE) to evaluate, via simulation, the performance of alternative management measures with respect to meeting rebuilding objectives for the stock [@dfo2013].
The current rebuilding plan implements an annual fixed TAC of 15 metric tonnes [@ifmp2018], which has not been simulation-tested.

Yelloweye Rockfish are a long-lived species [up to 121 years in B.C., @keppel2019], occurring in rocky demersal habitats that have a patchy, discontinuous distribution along BC's inner coast [@yamanaka2011].
These life history traits make the species vulnerable to overexploitation by fisheries.
The inside stock is considered to be data-limited, as there is sparse availability of age-composition data, a lack of biological data from commercial, recreational, and First Nations' fisheries, and uncertainty in the magnitude of historical catches.

## MANAGEMENT STRATEGY EVALUATION (MSE) {#sec:introduction-mse}

Worldwide, the provision of scientific advice for managing fisheries has been moving towards MSE (or management-oriented) approaches [e.g., @butterworth1999; @rademeyer2007; @berkson2015; @geromont2015; @punt2016; @carruthers2016].
MSE focuses on identifying MPs that perform best, with respect to meeting agreed-upon policy and fishery objectives, when implemented in a "closed-loop" simulation environment (Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart-basic)).
In output-controlled fisheries, such as the quota-managed BC groundfish fishery, MPs describe management measures for setting catch limits.
MPs can vary greatly in their data demands, from very data-rich approaches, including statistical catch-at-age stock assessments with harvest control rules, to simple data rules ("data-limited" approaches), which only rely on catch data and an index of abundance [e.g., @geromont2015; @carruthers2016].

Closed-loop simulation is distinguished from conventional stock assessment approaches because it simulates feedback between implementation of MPs and the underlying system (the fish stock and its environment), which is described by one or more operating models (OMs).
The closed-loop simulation approach takes into account the effect of the MPs on the system, as well as the future data collected from the system and its use in the MPs [@punt2016; @carruthers2018; @anderson2020gfmp].

(ref:fig-mse-chart-basic) Illustration of the fisheries closed-loop simulation process from @anderson2020gfmp following @punt2016. The management procedure may be based on a simple data rule (e.g., decrease the allowable catch x% if the survey index decreases y%) or it might be an estimation model combined with a harvest control rule.

## APPROACH {#sec:introduction-approach}

Data-limitations for the Inside Yelloweye stock pose a challenge to evaluating the expected performance of management measures needed to bring the stock into compliance with the Fish Stocks provisions, i.e., to build the stock out of the critical zone within the agreed time-frame and with the agreed probability.
Closed-loop simulation-testing of data-limited MPs allows for evaluation of the relative performance of MPs across a range of uncertainties in, for example, underlying fish biology, observation error, estimation error, and implementation error [e.g., @kell2006; @carruthers2016].

Since 2017, a partnership agreement between the University of British Columbia (UBC) and DFO [@dfo_dlmtool_2017] has supported development of two open-source software packages for MSE, implemented in the statistical programming environment R [@r2019]: the Data Limited Methods toolkit (DLMtool) [@carruthers2018; @carruthers_hordyk_2018] and the Management Strategy Evaluation toolkit (MSEtool) [@huynh_msetool_2019].
After several years of development, these packages provide some of the fastest, most flexible and extensible software for conducting MSE for fisheries. They can be applied to data-poor or data-rich stocks, enabling rapid assessment of multiple MPs according to customizable conservation and fisheries objectives, and evaluation of key trade-offs.

### The Management Procedure Framework for Groundfish in British Columbia {#sec:introduction-mp-framework}

Concurrently with the development of this document, a management procedure framework (MP Framework) for Groundfish in British Columbia [@anderson2020gfmp] has been developed for evaluating performance of a wide range of MPs for data-limited groundfish species.
The MP Framework uses the functionality of DLMtool and MSEtool extensively, supported by an R package gfdlm [@gfdlm] written by the authors of @anderson2020gfmp, which houses a suite of software support tools and custom visualizations.

We follow the MP Framework for selecting MPs to set catch limits for data-limited groundfish stocks [@anderson2020gfmp].
Our evaluation of the Inside Yelloweye rebuilding plan represents the first application of the MP Framework for providing science advice in support of catch decisions.
The framework follows six best practice steps described below and in greater detail in @anderson2020gfmp.

The best practice steps are based on a review by @punt2016, who identified five key steps in the MSE process (Steps 2--6 below).
An additional first step of the MP Framework, defining the decision context, was identified by @gregory2012 and @cox2016.
In large part, the DLMtool software has been designed to allow practitioners to follow these steps [Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart); @carruthers2018].

(ref:fig-mse-chart) The steps of the MSE process following @punt2016 as implemented in DLMtool. Copied from @anderson2020gfmp and adapted from @carruthers2018. This figure expands on Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart-basic).

```{r mse-chart, fig.cap="(ref:fig-mse-chart)", out.width="\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs/mse-chart.png"))
```

The six steps are as follows:

  Step 1: Definition of the decision context.

  Step 2: Selection of objectives and performance metrics.

  Step 3: Selection of uncertainties/specification of operating models.

  Step 4: Identification of candidate management procedures.

  Step 5: Simulation of the application of the management procedures.

  Step 6: Presentation of results and selection of management procedure.

After selection and implementation of the MP for setting the catch limit (Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart); e.g., applying the selected MP algorithm to the observed survey index), a final necessary step is to periodically monitor and evaluate the performance of the MP [@dfo2013; @dowling2015a; @carruthers2018]. 
This may be done through informal means, e.g., via feedback from fishers and survey information [e.g., @cox2008a], or through more formal statistical measures, where observed data are compared to predictions from the OMs to test whether the system is performing as expected [@butterworth2008; @carruthers_hordyk_2018; discussed in @anderson2020gfmp].

In the following sections, we describe our approach for developing a candidate rebuilding plan for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, following the six best practice steps.
