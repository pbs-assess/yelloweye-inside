# BIOLOGICAL DATA {#app:biological-data}

Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, which reside in area 4B (Figure \@ref(fig:map-4B)), are genetically distinct from the outside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish, whose range covers the rest of the coast [@andrews2018; @siegle2011; @siegle2013]. The northerly boundary between the two stocks is found in the middle of the Queen Charlotte Strait, north of Malcolm Island. Understanding of the Southern boundary has recently changed, based on analyses presented in @andrews2018, who argue that the Victoria Sill is the most likely geological boundary between the two populations and that the inside population extends into Puget Sound. Groundfish management area 4B is used to define the inside stock, despite the fact that area 4B extends beyond the boundaries of the biological population (Figure \@ref(fig:map-4B)). The inside and outside stocks are also considered two separate designatable units by COSEWIC [@cosewic2008].

## AGE, SIZE, AND GROWTH {#sec:growth}

Yelloweye Rockfish are a long-lived species, with a reported maximum age of 121 *y* for the outside stock [@keppel2019]. The maximum observed age for the inside Yelloweye Rockfish stock is 101 years, updated from the previously reported max age of 98 years based on additional recent ageing data (Figure \@ref(fig:age-freq)). 
Age data for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, derived from the break and burn or break and bake methods, are available from various surveys in area 4B from 1984-2018.
Directed hard-bottom longline (HBLL) surveys began in Area 4B in 2003 after which greater numbers of Yelloweye Rockfish were aged.
Proportions-at-age of Yelloweye Rockfish are shown by year and sex in Figure \@ref(fig:age-freq). It is assumed that all ages are independent of subarea.
Human error can occur in reading ages from otoliths. Ageing precision for inside Yelloweye Rockfish is plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:age-precision) which displays ages for fish that were aged twice by independent technicians, including each technicians' reported range of possible ages.


Inside Yelloweye Rockfish grow up to 75.9 cm in length for males and 76.9 cm for females (Figure \@ref(fig:length-freq)). The maximum recorded weight is 8.0 kg for both males and females. Length-weight model fits and plots for all available survey data in area 4B are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:length-weight). It is assumed that all measurements are independent of subarea. The length-weight curve is of the form:

$$
\log (W_i) \sim \operatorname{Student-t}(df = 3, \log(a) + b \log(L_i), \sigma),
$$

with $W_i$ and $L_i$ representing the weight and length for fish $i$, respectively, and $\sigma$ representing the observation error scale.
We set the degrees of freedom of the Student-t distribution to 3 to be robust to outliers [@anderson2019synopsis].
The variables $a$ and $b$ represent the estimated length-weight parameters.
Length-age model fits and plots for inside Yelloweye Rockfish are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:length-age). The length-age growth curve is a von Bertalanffy model of the form:

$$
L_i \sim \operatorname{Log-normal}
\left( \log(l_\mathrm{inf} (1 - \exp(-k (A_i - t_0)))) -
\sigma^2 / 2, \sigma \right),
$$

where $L_i$ and $A_i$ represent the length and age of fish $i$, $l_\mathrm{inf}$, $k$, and $t_0$ represent the von Bertalanffy growth parameters, and $\sigma$ represents the scale parameter. The term $- \sigma^2 /2$ represents a 
lognormal bias adjustment term so we model the mean length rather than the median.
The model was fit in TMB as described in @anderson2019synopsis.

## MATURITY {#sec:maturity}

Yelloweye Rockfish, in addition to being large and long-lived, are also slow to mature. In order to examine age at maturity, sample records from all surveys within area 4B were analyzed for specimens that were identified as male or female with a valid maturity code and for which age was determined using the break and burn or break and bake methods. 

Maturity ogives are fit as logistic regressions to individual fish specimens, which are categorized as mature vs. not mature against length or age (Figure \@ref(fig:percent-maturity)):

\begin{align}
y_i &\sim \mathrm{Binomial}(\pi_i)\\
\mathrm{logit} \left( \pi_i \right) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 F_i
\end{align}

where $y_i$ represents a 1 if fish $i$ is considered mature and a 0 if fish $i$
is considered immature. The $\beta$ parameters represent estimated coefficients,
$x_i$ represents either the length or age of fish $i$, and $F_i$ represents
a binary predictor that is 1 if the fish is female and 0 if the fish is male.
The variable $\pi_i$ represents the expected probability of fish $i$ being
mature. Models are fit to all available survey samples regardless of time of
year. Predicted vs. observed proportions mature-at-age are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:prop-mature).

(ref:fig-percent-maturity) Age-at-maturity ogive plots for inside Yelloweye Rockfish. The solid black lines represent fits to the female fish and the dashed grey lines represent fits to the male fish. The vertical lines indicate the estimated age at 50% maturity. Text on the panels indicates the estimated age at 5, 50 and 95% maturity for females (F) and males (M). Short rug lines along the top and bottom represent up to 1500 randomly chosen individual fish with a small amount of random jittering to help differentiate individual fish.

Maturity frequency by each month is shown in the bubble plot in Figure \@ref(fig:mat-months) for all fish in all surveys within area 4B for which maturity was sampled. Categories of maturity are listed from most immature (top) to most mature (bottom); individual fish, once mature, cycle through the mature stages.

## GENERATION TIME {#sec:generation}

Rebuilding guidance states that the timelines for rebuilding should be 1.5 to 2 times the generation time of the species [@dfo2013], where generation time is the average number of years between the birth of an individual and the birth of its offspring. 
A recent analysis for the Outside Yelloweye Rockfish stock estimated generation time at approximately 38 years which was the average age of the modeled unfished spawning stock [@cox2020]. 
We fixed generation time for Inside Yelloweye to be equal to that estimated for Outside Yelloweye Rockfish to align rebuilding timeframes between the two stocks.  

However, previous generation time estimates from COSEWIC and Pre-COSEWIC reports have been calculated using age at maturity and natural mortality (age at 50% maturity + 1/M). In 2008, a natural mortality rate of 0.02 and age at 50% maturity for females in the inside stock of 37.5 years were used to estimate generation time at 70 years [@cosewic2008], which is now thought to be higher than it probably is. 
In 2018, this was revised to be 40.5 to 45.0 years using a natural mortality of 0.038 and age at 50% maturity of 14.2 to 18.7 years, estimated using commercial and research data, respectively [@keppel2019]. 
Using this formula and the median estimate of natural mortality used in our baseline OM, 0.045, and the inside 50% maturity presented in Figure \@ref(fig:percent-maturity), the generation time would be 36 for females and 40 for males. 
There is, of course, great uncertainty associated with the estimation of generation time using this formula given that natural mortality is usually listed as the major axis of uncertainty in any stock assessment (e.g. @gertseva2017, this analysis). 
Maturity estimates, especially the classification of mature and immature individuals when done macroscopically, are also imprecise [@head2016]. 
Lastly, age estimates are also subject to error (Figure \@ref(fig:age-precision) replotted from Appendix A of the BC Groundfish Data Synopsis Report [@anderson2019synopsis]).

(ref:fig-age-precision) Ageing precision plot for inside Yelloweye Rockfish. Each dot and cross-hatch represents an individual fish that has been aged twice. The x-axis represents the age and upper and lower ends of the possible age range recorded for the initial ('primary') ageing of the fish. The y-axis represents the equivalent values recorded for the second ('precision') ageing of the fish by a different technician. The dashed diagonal line represents a perfect one-to-one agreement between the two ages. 300 fish have been randomly sampled from all Yelloweye Rockfish precision-aged, and a small amount of random jitter has been added to both axes to reduce overplotting with the same jitter value added to both the x and y axes for a given fish.
