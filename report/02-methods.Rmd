# METHODS

*TODO: Edit all of this text. Placeholder for now. RF can do this*

We follow the methods recommended in the Management Procedure Framework for Groundfish in British Columbia [@anderson2020]. The framework follows six best practice steps described below. For more details on the best practice steps see @anderson2020.

@punt2016 reviewed best practices for MSE and identified five key steps in the process (Steps 2--6 below). In large part, the DLMtool software has been designed to allow practitioners to follow these steps [Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart); @carruthers2018]. We also identify a critical first step (Step 1 below): defining the decision context [@gregory2012 and Cox and Benson (unpublished)].

*TODO: Mention this is done in a simulation framework. Very briefly introduce dlmtool and msetool here*

* Step 1: define the decision context

* Step 2: selection of objectives and performance metrics 

* Step 3: selection of uncertainties/specification of operating models 

* Step 4: identification of candidate management procedures 

* Step 5: simulation of the application of the management procedures 

* Step 6: presentation of results and selection of management procedure

*TODO: possibly add Step 7 ... monitoring future surveys and triggering review of OM if surveys are outside projection envelope"

## BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING A MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE APPROACH 

### STEP 1: DEFINE THE DECISION CONTEXT {#sec:approach1}

The decision to be made is which MP to use to determine catch limits for the period until the next available catch advice. The time-frame for making the decision should be stated in the request for science advice.

The boundaries on the project ...

The final decision on which MP to use to determine catch limits should be made based on a consensus by the Regional Peer Review (RPR) committee, after review of the scientific content of the advice (including the structure and content of the OMs), and consideration of the relative performance of the MPs with respect to meeting stated objectives and trade-offs among performance metrics. 

### STEP 2: SELECTION OF OBJECTIVES AND PERFORMANCE METRICS  {#sec:approach2}

Here we describe a set of provisional objectives and associated performance metrics. In real applications of the framework, objectives should be refined on a stock-by-stock basis, with advice from Fisheries Management, First Nations, commercial and recreational fishing representatives, NGOs and other affected parties. Other objectives could be added (e.g., cultural objectives), decided on a stock-by-stock basis.

Key provisional conservation objectives are guided by the PA Framework [@dfo2006; @dfo2009] and rebuilding plan guidance [**REF**], elements of which are incorporated into the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* (see Section \@ref(motivation)). Additional objectives related to fisheries yield and variability in annual fisheries yield are based on precedents in other DFO Pacific Region analyses [e.g., @cox2008a; @forrest2018; @cox2019].

We propose the following provisional tactical conservation and fisheries objectives:

*TODO: LIST THE REBUILDING PLAN OBJECTIVES. How have these changed compared to the original objectives and why? - MJB first crack*

The rebuilding plan objectives for Inside Yelloweye were published in Appendix 9 of the Pacfic Region Integrated Fishery Management Plan (IFMP) for Groundfish in 2018 [@DFO2018]. The original rebuilding plan objectives were:
*"Rebuild the stock above the LRP over 80 years with 56% probability of success".
*"Achieve positive trends within each 10 year period"
The management procedure that was agreed upon to meet these objectives was to keep the the combined TAC (commercial, recreational, FSC) below 15 tonnes annually [@DFO2018]. 

For this analysis, a set of refined objectives were proposed for Inside Yelloweye in order to be consistent with legislated requirements under the new *Fisheries Act*, specify the length of the projection period to be used for simulations, and to account for other processes, including the anticipated re-assessment by COSEWIC. The new objectives are:
*"Rebuild the stock above the LRP over 56 years (1.5 generations) with at least 95% probability of success"
*"Achieve positive trends in biomass within each 10 year period or if the stock is above the LRP" <!--I think this one is not correctly worded, I took it from Quang's presentation but I'm not sure where to find the proper one (MJB)-->

*TODO: Also list COSEWIC indicators- MJB first crack*
COSEWIC and DFO have different criteria for assessing the status of marine fish stocks. DFO focuses on current status relative to some reference state or threshold, while COSEWIC criteria (based on IUCN Red List categories) are more focused on the probability of decline over past generations and the probability of continued declines in the future e.g. Criteria A1,2,3,or 4 in [@COSEWIC2015]. In order for this analysis to inform the COSEWIC re-assessment, we report the probability that the stock has declined at least 30%, 50%, and 70% over the past 3 generations. <!--Not sure how the whole discussion around extinction risk (COSEWIC indicator E) came out. From the emails I read this quantitative metric is rarely used by COSEWIC for marine fishes (MJB) -->

*TODO: List the performance metrics - MJB first crack*
We propose the following performance metrics, where MSY refers to maximum sustainable yield, *B*~MSY~ refers to equilibrium spawning biomass at MSY, and *F*~MSY~ refers to the fishing mortality that produces MSY over the long term:
<!--from the powerpoint slides from Quang (MJB)-->

  * LRP 1.5 GT		P[B > 0.4 BMSY] after 1.5 GT (56 years) Satisficing: only consider MPs with 95% probability
  * LRP 1GT		    P[SSB > LRP] after 1 GT (38 years) 		
  * USR 1.5 GT		P[SSB > USR] after 56 years
  		
  * ST C10		P[Catch > 10 t] during 2020-2029
  * ST C15    P[Catch > 15 t] during 2020-2029
  * LT C20		P[Catch > 20 t] during 2020-2029
  * LT C20		P[Catch > 20 t] after 1 Generation time
  * AAVC			Probability of < 20% inter-annual variability in catch

Performance metrics are averaged across reference set of OMs or reported individually. 


### STEP 3: SELECTION OF UNCERTAINTIES/SPECIFICATION OF OPERATING MODELS {#sec:approach3}

DLMtool OMs are organized into four main components representing a real fished system:

1. population dynamics of the fish stock (e.g., growth, recruitment, mortality);
2. fishery dynamics (e.g., selectivity, spatial targeting);
3. observation processes (e.g., bias and precision in survey indices); and
4. management implementation (e.g., percentage overages of catch limits).

Parameters under the four components are entered into "slots" [terminology referring to a feature of the S4 object-oriented system in R; @r2019] and in Appendix B of @carruthers2018.

DLMtool allows the incorporation of uncertainty in most OM parameters through optional specification of a distribution, typically a uniform distribution between two bounds. See Appendix B of @carruthers2018 for a full list of parameters for which a distribution can be specified. However, to isolate the effects of specific sources of uncertainty on performance of MPs, we recommend development of alternative OMs that change the value (or distribution) of one parameter or data source of interest.

We recommend developing more than one OM, dividing OMs into a reference set of core OMs representing the most important plausible model uncertainties, and a robustness set for testing sensitivity to a broader range of structural uncertainties [@rademeyer2007].

*Identify key uncertainties to include in OMs in the reference and robustness sets*

We note that DLMtool OMs includes a very large number of parameters that can vary through time, or which can be set to be deliberately biased. To simplify the operating model and focus on what are likely the most important axes of uncertainty, we suggest fixing most parameters to be time-invariant and unbiased (see @anderson2020, their Appendix \@ref(app:default-slots)). 

Best practice recommends calibrating OMs with observed data so they can reproduce historical observations (e.g., indices of abundance, age-composition data). 

*TODO: shorten this and make specific to Inside YE*
DLMtool's companion software package, MSEtool [@huynh_msetool_2019], includes an extremely efficient implementation of a stock reduction analysis (SRA) [@kimura1982; @walters2006], which is effectively a catch-at-age model that estimates the combinations of historical fishing mortality and recruitment that would be consistent with the observed data. The SRA implementation in MSEtool can be conditioned on catch or effort time series. For most applications for BC groundfish stocks, we suggest conditioning on catch, as historical trajectories of catch tend to be more reliable than time series of effort, especially given uncertainties in how to best represent and interpret effort in multispecies fisheries. An advantage of using MSEtool's SRA for calibrating OMs is it allows fitting to multiple indices of abundance, and can accommodate multiple fishing fleets if needed.

The SRA model is used to condition the following OM parameters:

* unfished recruitment
* depletion
* relative fishing effort
* annual recruitment deviations
* selectivity parameters (if age or length composition data are included as inputs to the SRA)

*TODO. Decide if we will have our own SRA appendix or refer to MP Framework*

Further details on the SRA OM-calibration model are available in Appendix \@ref(app:sra).

### STEP 4: IDENTIFICATION OF CANDIDATE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES  {#sec:approach4}

@anderson2020 screened all MPs available in DLMtool as of November 2019 along with recent MPs used in BC groundfish reports to consider their appropriateness for the framework.
This represents a fairly comprehensive set of data-limited MPs available in the primary literature or agency reports to date.

We describe candidate MPs for consideration for Inside YE in detail in Appendix \@ref(app:MPs).

DLMtool includes MPs that make different types of management recommendations.
These recommendations include adjustments to total allowable catch (TAC), effort, or spatial allocation of catch or effort.
For Inside YE, we focus on MPs that make TAC recommendations because the stock is managed by quotas.

We focus on two main types of MPs: data-based and model-based MPs.

All MPs included in this framework are fully described in Appendix \@ref(app:MPs).

#### Data-based MPs

*TODO. List the MPs we are using and refer to the appendix*

#### Model-based MPs

*TODO. List the MPs we are using and refer to the appendix*

#### Reference MPs

In addition to the candidate MPs, it is important to include reference MPs. Provisionally, we suggest the following reference MPs:

* No fishing
* Fishing at F/F~MSY~
* Fishing at 0.75 F/F~MSY~
* Maintaining the current TAC

The purpose of reference MPs is not to explore viable management strategies but to bound the range of expected or possible performance and contextualize whether differences between performance statistics among MPs are meaningful [@punt2016]. For example, the "no fishing" reference MPs provides information on maximum possible stock levels and the maximum possible rate of rebuilding under a rebuilding scenario. The "fishing at 0.75 F/F~MSY~" MP illustrates performance under an omniscient manager with perfect information. The MP that maintains the current TAC is included not because we think it is necessarily a good management strategy but illustrates what is likely the default had the framework not been implemented and illustrates the long-term performance expectations given current exploitation levels.


### STEP 5: SIMULATION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES  {#sec:approach5}

Once the objectives, performance metrics, calibrated OMs and MPs are fully specified, a closed-loop simulation framework (Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart)) can be applied to test relative performance of the MPs with respect to meeting the stated objectives.

We recommend beginning with a satisficing step, where trial simulations are run to screen out MPs that do not meet a basic set of performance criteria [@miller2010].
For example, in our illustrative Rex Sole case study (Appendix \@ref(app:mse-rex)), we screened out MPs that did not achieve a long-term 90% probability of keeping the stock above the LRP (LT P40 $\geq$ 0.9) and a short-term 75% probability of yield above 50% MSY (STY $\geq$ 0.75).
This resulted in **XX** final MPs, plus the four reference MPs.

DLMtool is designed to follow standard MSE operating procedure (Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart)), where the OM is used to simulate the various data streams required by the MP at each time step, then the biomass is projected forward under the prescribed MP at each subsequent time step until the projection period is complete.
Performance is then evaluated through calculation of performance statistics in the OM.
DLMtool makes use of the C++ programming language and parallel processing, making the simulations computationally efficient [@carruthers2018].

For each OM-MP combination, multiple replicate projections are run to account for observation and process errors in the data streams.
This is achieved by adding stochastic noise to the data (e.g, indices of abundance) before passing them to the MP. Coefficients of variation in the data should be consistent with those in historical observations [@rademeyer2007]. Typically, at least 100 replicate simulations are run for each OM/MP combination.
We suggest selecting sufficient replicates so that the rank order of MPs across the performance metrics remains consistent regardless of additional iterations [@carruthers_user_2019].
