# SELECTION OF UNCERTAINTIES/SPECIFICATION OF OPERATING MODELS {#sec:om}

DLMtool OMs are organized into four main components representing a real fished system:

1. population dynamics of the fish stock (e.g., growth, recruitment, mortality);
2. fishery dynamics (e.g., selectivity, spatial targeting);
3. observation processes (e.g., bias and precision in survey indices); and
4. management implementation (e.g., catch limit overages).

Equations and parameters describing the four OM components are provided in detail in Appendix B of @carruthers2018 and Appendix A of @anderson2020gfmp.
DLMtool allows the incorporation of uncertainty in many OM parameters through optional specification of probability distributions.
To further isolate the effects of specific sources of uncertainty on performance of MPs, we develop alternative OMs that change the value (or distribution) of one or more parameters and/or data sources of interest (Section \@ref(sec:approach3-oms)).

Best practice recommends calibrating or conditioning OMs with observed data, so they can reproduce historical observations.
DLMtool's companion software package, MSEtool [@huynh_msetool_2019], includes an efficient implementation of a stock reduction analysis (SRA) [@kimura1982; @walters2006], which is effectively a statistical catch-at-age model that estimates the combinations of historical fishing mortality and recruitment that would be consistent with the observed data. The SRA is fully described in Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp.

There are two distinct time-periods in the simulation framework:
(1) the historical period, which includes all years from the first year of the observed catch time series $t_1$ to the final year of the observed catch time series $t_c$ (where "c" represents the "current" year); and
(2) the projection period, which covers the period from the first year after $t_c$ to the final projection year $t_N$.
The historical period is conditioned on historical observations using the SRA [see Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp].
The closed-loop simulations, with application of the MPs and calculation of performance metrics, begin in the first year of the projection period (year $t_{c+1}$).

OM development in the MP Framework follows three steps:

1. Set parameter values and ranges in the OM.

2. Pass the OM parameters to the SRA model, which conditions the OM by fitting to historical observed catches, indices of abundance, and any available years of age-composition data.
This results in conditioned estimates of model parameters and estimates of historical biomass and historical fishing mortality (in years $t_1$ to $t_c$), which are consistent with historical observations.

3. Pass the conditioned parameter values back to the OM (now the "conditioned" OM) for use in the closed-loop simulation projections, starting in year $t_{c+1}$.

Where possible, we derived OM settings from all available survey biological data from area 4B, which is primarily collected on the inside hard bottom longline (HBLL) surveys (Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
We derived other parameters from the scientific literature and stock assessments for Yelloweye Rockfish in other areas (see Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye) for details).
A list of "default" OM parameter settings recommended for most BC groundfish stocks is provided in Appendix C of @anderson2020gfmp.

We conditioned the OMs with the SRA, using age-composition data from research surveys (Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)), inside HBLL survey indices (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data)), and commercial and recreational catch data (Appendix \@ref(app:catch-data)).
Results from conditioning the OMs are provided below in Section \@ref(sec:approach3-conditioning).

## OPERATING MODELS {#sec:approach3-oms}

MSE best practice recommends dividing MSE trials into a "reference set" of core OMs that include the most important uncertainties (e.g., depletion of the stock or range of natural mortality values), and a "robustness set", to capture a wider range of uncertainties that may be less plausible but should nonetheless be explored [@rademeyer2007].
@anderson2020gfmp recommended presenting performance metrics from the reference and robustness sets separately.
They recommended that, for most results, reference set performance metrics should be averaged across all OM reference set scenarios (an ensemble approach to integrate across OM uncertainties) but that performance metrics from individual OM robustness set scenarios should be presented separately. 
Presenting robustness results separately allows managers to see how MPs that performed well in the reference set perform under a set of more diverse assumptions [@rademeyer2007].

For Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, we established four reference set OMs: (1) a baseline OM; (2) an OM reflecting an alternative assumption about the magnitude of historical catch during the period 1986--2005; (3) an OM allowing for episodic (rare but large) future recruitment events; and (4) an OM estimating selectivity in the HBLL survey (Table \@ref(tab:ye-scen)).

We further established two robustness set OMs encompassing additional sources of uncertainty: (A) an OM that assumes lower natural mortality than the other OMs; and (B) an OM that assumes a higher coefficient of variation (CV) in the future HBLL survey (Table \@ref(tab:ye-scen)).

    col_names = c("OM Scenario name", "Set type")) %>%

```

### Reference set {#sec:approach3-reference}

The following OMs were developed as the reference set. We hereafter refer to them by their numbers, e.g., OM Scenario (1).

#### Reference set: (1) Base {#sec:approach3-reference1}

Data sources are provided in Appendices \@ref(app:biological-data) through \@ref(app:catch-data).
Parameter settings for the Base OM are provided in Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye).
We here provide a brief description of the Base OM assumptions that were adjusted in other OM scenarios.

There are two main uncertainties associated with the historical commercial catch time series for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish (details in Appendix \@ref(app:catch-data), Section \@ref(sec:com-catch-data)).
These are: (1) aggregated reporting of rockfish as Other Rockfish (ORF; rockfish species other than Pacific Ocean Perch) and (2) the magnitude of unreported catch that was discarded at sea prior to the introduction of 100% at-sea monitoring in the groundfish longline fleet in 2006 [@stanley2009].
For consistency with @yamanaka2011, we doubled the nominal catch data for the period 1986---2005, as industry did not have confidence in the catch data for those years [@dfo2012; see  Appendix \@ref(app:catch-data), Section \@ref(sec:com-catch-data)].

Projected recruitment deviations were sampled in log space with standard deviation $\tau = 0.4$, with autocorrelation estimated post-hoc from the historical recruitment deviates in the SRA model [Appendix A of @anderson2020gfmp].

The Inside Yelloweye Rockfish stock is indexed by two fishery-independent surveys: the inside Hard Bottom Longline Survey (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:hbll-index-data)) and the Dogfish Survey (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:dogfish-index-data)).
The SRA model exhibited better retrospective behaviour when the SRA model was fit with more likelihood weight applied to the Dogfish Survey. The age of full selectivity in the HBLL survey was fixed at 22 years (see Section \@ref(sec:approach3-conditioning) below).

Historical commerical CPUE was also available and used as an index of abundance for conditioning the OM [@yamanaka2011]. Following the decisions made for the 2011 assessment, the time series was divided into three stanzas (1986-1990, 1995-2001, and 2003-2005), representing periods when fishery behaviour is likely to have changed in response to management regulations (Appendix \@ref(app:catch-data), Section \@ref(sec:management-changes)). 

Natural mortality (*M*) was sampled  from a probability distribution based on that used by @yamanaka2011, where $M \sim \textrm{Lognormal}(0.045, 0.2)$ (Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye), Section \@ref(app:desc-stock-m-yelloweye)).

During the projection period, only the HBLL index was assumed to be available for the MPs, as this survey is conducted annually. Projecting only one index of abundance is consistent with many data-limited MPs, which only use a single index of abundance (see Appendix \@ref(app:mps)).
Observation error in the projected index values was simulated with random deviates from a lognormal distribution with mean of 1 and standard deviation of 0.25 based on the estimated observation error in the HBLL index.

All other OM scenarios were adjusted from this baseline OM and differed only in terms of adjustments to key parameters or data sources, described below.

#### (2) Low catch {#sec:approach3-reference2}

In the "Low catch" OM scenario, we test model sensitivity to the assumption of large unreported catch for the period 1986--2005.
Instead of doubling nominal catch data for this period, the SRA was fit to the nominal catch data.
As for the other OM scenarios, we used the reconstructed catch up to 1985 and the nominal catch from 1986 onwards.

#### (3) Episodic recruitment {#sec:approach3-reference3}

Long-lived, late-maturing species such as Pacific rockfishes often exhibit episodic, or periodic, recruitment strategies characterized by high fecundity and occasional very large recruitment events [@winemiller1992; @rose2001; @winemiller2005].
This life history strategy is sometimes called the storage effect (@warner1985) because strong recruitment events are stored in the adult population and are capable of contributing to reproduction, sometimes significantly, when favourable conditions return. 
Longevity in rockfish is thought to have evolved as a strategy for weathering un-favourable conditions.
Very large or even extreme year classes have been observed for several BC rockfish species [e.g., Pacific Ocean Perch: @haigh2019; Bocaccio: @haigh2020].


To address the possibility that future recruitment during the projection period could be characterized by occasional very large recruitment events, we included an "Episodic recruitment" OM scenario.
This OM scenario addresses the concern that very large cohorts are not adequately modelled by the lognormal distribution for recruitment deviations that was used in OM Scenario (1).
In the Episodic recruitment OM scenario, recruitment deviations $\varepsilon_{R,y}$ for each year of the projection period are generated as:

$$
\varepsilon_{R,y} = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\varepsilon^{(1)}_{R,y} & \eta_y = 0\\
\varepsilon^{(3)}_{R,y} & \eta_y = 1,
\end{array}
\right.
$$

where $\varepsilon^{(1)}_{R,y}$ is the recruitment deviation from OM Scenario (1) and
$\log\varepsilon^{(3)}_{R,y} \sim \textrm{Normal}(-0.5\tau^2, \tau)$ represents the "episodic" recruitment distribution with $\tau = 2$ (standard deviation).
The parameter $\eta_y$ is a Bernoulli random variable $\eta_y \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(p = 1/38)$, which selects whether an extreme recruitment event will occur. 
We assume that an extreme recruitment event is expected to occur once every generation (38 years), based on the observation that strong recruitment events in Inside Yelloweye Rockfish were present in 1948 and 1970. 
Although recent environmental conditions may be favourable for some species of rockfishes [@haigh2020; @lincandeo2020], we don't yet have any evidence of recent strong recruitment events for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish that might indicate more frequent episodic or spasmodic recruitment events. 

#### (4) Estimate HBLL selectivity {#sec:approach3-reference4}

Annual sample sizes of age-composition data from research surveys are very small (Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)). 
This makes estimation of selectivity in the surveys highly uncertain, which led to the choice to fix survey selectivity in the other OM scenarios.

Given large uncertainty in our choice of selectivity, we allowed the SRA to estimate selectivity for the surveys in this OM scenario and utilized the available survey age-composition data.

### Robustness set {#sec:approach3-robustness}

The following OMs were developed as the robustness set. We hereafter refer to them by their letters.

#### (A) Low M {#sec:approach3-referenceA}

Lower values of natural mortality have been used for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish [@yamanaka2001; @cosewic2008; @wood2019]. This OM scenario used a lower mean in the distribution for *M*, with $M \sim \textrm{Lognormal}(0.025, 0.2)$, reflecting the possibility that the stock could be less productive than assumed in the other OM scenarios. 

#### (B) Higher HBLL CV {#sec:approach3-referenceB}

```{r higher-cv}
SRA_highCV <- readRDS(here::here("mse/om/updog_fixsel.rds"))
Iobs <- SRA_highCV@OM@cpars$Data@AddInd[1, , ] %>% t()
Ipred <- lapply(SRA_highCV@Misc, getElement, "Ipred")
Isd <- rbind %>% do.call(lapply(Ipred, function(x, y) apply(log(y/x), 2, function(xx) sd(xx, na.rm = TRUE)), y = Iobs))
mean_Isd <- mean(Isd[,1])
range_Isd <- range(Isd[,1])
```

This OM scenario considers the possibility that the future HBLL index might be less precise than assumed in the other OM scenarios.
Instead of an observation standard deviation $\sigma_I = 0.25$, we use the standard deviation ($\sigma_I$) and autocorrelation ($\theta_\textrm{AC}$) from the index residuals in OM Scenario (1), obtained from the SRA fit to the HBLL index.

This $\sigma_I$ has a mean of `r round2(mean_Isd)` and a range of `r round2(range_Isd[1])`--`r round2(range_Isd[2])`.

## CONDITIONING THE OPERATING MODELS {#sec:approach3-conditioning} 

After specifying the OM parameters (Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye)), we conditioned the OMs using the SRA model described in Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp.

Note that the DLMtool OM combines all fleets into a single fleet.
However, if the OM is conditioned using the SRA model, the SRA can accommodate multiple fleets, and selectivity is fleet-specific.
In this case, fishery selectivity in the OM for the projection period is replaced with the SRA-conditioned estimates of fishing mortality-at-age in the final year  of the historical period ($t_c$), normalized by dividing by apical fishing mortality in that year.
This essentially provides the DLMtool OM with relative selectivity-at-age, weighted by catch across all fleets.
The closed-loop simulation projections therefore assume that the relative selectivity across fleets remains constant in the projection period.

Similarly, if the OM is conditioned using the SRA model, analysts can also specify (or estimate) selectivity parameters for the individual indices of abundance (in this case two fishery-independent surveys and three commercial CPUE series (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-fits))).
In this case, the SRA passes all of the indices back to DLMtool, preserving the estimated or user-defined selectivities-at-age for each index.
However, note that the DLMtool MPs only utilize a single index of abundance (see Appendix \@ref(app:mps)).
In the current study, all index-based MPs utilize the inside HBLL survey.

We used the SRA to populate the following parameters in the conditioned OMs:

- $B_{t_c}/B_0$ (or "D"; depletion in the last historical year $t_c$)
- $R_0$ (unfished recruitment)
- $\theta_\textrm{AC}$ (or "AC"; first-order autocorrelation of recruitment deviations)
- $\varepsilon_{\textrm{R},y}$ for years $t_1$ to $t_c$ (annual recruitment deviations)
- $F_{a,y}$ (fishing mortality at age by year)

See Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp for details on these parameters.

The SRA was run for 250 replicates.
Each replicate used a different value of *M* and *h* (sampled independently from the distributions shown in Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye), except for OM Scenario (A), which used a different distribution for *M*).
The model was initialized under the assumption that spawning biomass ($B_y$) was in an unfished equilibrium state prior to 1918, the first year of the time series, i.e., $B_{1918} = B_0$.
While this is unlikely to be true, as First Nations and others would have been catching Yelloweye Rockfish prior to 1918, these numbers are expected to be small enough not to impact the outcomes of the performance of MPs in the projection period.

### Selection of base OM {#sec:approach3-conditioning-base-om}

Initial attempts to fit the SRA model did not produce good fits to the dogfish survey.
Furthermore, retrospective analysis showed persistent retrospective bias in annual estimates of spawning biomass when sequentially removing 11 years of data (when evaluated at the mean values of *M* and *h*, Figure \@ref(fig:retro-initial), top panel).
The choice to base retrospective analysis on 11 years of data was primarily to evaluate sensitivity of the model to removal of each year of data, going back to 2009, the terminal year for the 2011 assessment.

Increasing the likelihood weight for the SRA fit to the Dogfish survey [$\lambda^I_s = 4$; Equation B.22 in @anderson2020gfmp], and fixing age-at-full-selectivity in the HBLL survey to 22 years, removed the retrospective pattern (Figure \@ref(fig:retro-initial), bottom panel). 
Therefore, for OM Scenario (1) and all other OM scenarios except Scenario (4), we fixed the age-at-full selectivity of the HBLL Survey at 22 years (Figure \@ref(fig:HBLL-selectivity)), while also upweighting the Dogfish survey.

(ref:fig-retro-initial) Retrospective patterns in spawning biomass for the initial fit and OM Scenario (1). Coloured lines represent estimates of spawning biomass with $X$ years of data removed, where $X$ is shown in the legend for each series.

```{r retro-initial, fig.cap="(ref:fig-retro-initial)", out.width="4.25in"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("mse/figures/retrospective-spawning-biomass.png"))
```

There are a number of factors that increase uncertainty in estimating selectivity for the Dogfish survey e.g. the absence of biological data from this survey, and changes in fishing operations and hook type that occurred in 2004 (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:dogfish-index-data)). There are also several differences between the HBLL and Dogfish longline surveys (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:dogfish-index-data)), but, for the reasons mentioned, we cannot reliably estimate the selectivity for the Dogfish survey. Out of necessity, selectivity in the Dogfish survey was set to mirror selectivity in the HBLL survey, whether it was estimated (OM Scenario (4)) or fixed (all other OM scenarios).

Age composition data from the commerical fishery were available from a single fishing trip in 1989, and length samples from 2002--2019 were identified from the recreational fishery. Attempts to fit the SRA model to these data did not produce satisfactory estimates of selectivity. The estimated values of the age of full selectivity were very high, suggesting that most ages were not completely vulnerable to the fishery, and significantly differed from values estimated for the Outside Yelloweye population [@cox2020]. Since it is unlikely that selectivity varies to such an extent between geographical regions, these data were not further considered. 

As a result, selectivity for these gears was fixed in all OM scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:sra-selectivity)).
Parameter values were set so that the selectivity-at-age curves approximated those estimated by @cox2020 for the commercial longline and recreational fisheries for outside Yelloweye Rockfish (see Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye), Section \@ref(app:desc-fleet-selectivity-yelloweye)).
As noted above, these selectivities were returned to the DLMtool OMs as a combined-fleet selectivity curve from the terminal year ($t_c$) of the historical period (Figure \@ref(fig:om-selectivity)).

### OM conditioning results {#sec:approach3-conditioning-results} 

#### Fits to data {#sec:approach3-conditioning-indices}

The predicted catch in the SRA models matched the catch data by design, which was achieved by setting the standard deviation of the observation error to a value of 0.01 [@anderson2020gfmp, their Equation B.27].

The SRA was able to fit to the indices of abundance reasonably well (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-fits)) and convergence was achieved for all replicates in all OM scenarios.
For all OM scenarios, the estimated index fell within the observed confidence intervals in most years, although there were some outliers (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-fits)).
The fit to the early 1986  and 1989 observations in the Dogfish Survey was slightly better in OM Scenario (A), which is consistent with a less productive, more depleted stock. However, these two observations are more uncertain than those in recent years, due to changes in fishing operations and hook type that occurred in 2004 (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:dogfish-index-data)).
Fits to the commercial CPUE series were generally good, due to the short time stanzas for each series (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-fits)).

(ref:fig-survey-fits)

Panels from left to right represent OM scenarios.
Thin lines represent individual SRA model fits across stochastic draws from the various OM parameters.
Dots represent index mean and line segments represent 2 times the standard errors as entered into the SRA models.

```{r survey-fits, fig.cap="(ref:fig-survey-fits)", out.width="\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("mse/figures/ye-index-fits.png"))
```

The SRA model fit the survey age-composition data reasonably well, despite very small sample sizes (Figures \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-comp-fit1) to \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-comp-fitB)). We note that in comparing OM Scenarios (1) and (4) it appears that fixing or estimating selectivity in the HBLL survey did not generate very different fits to the age composition data (Figures \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-comp-fit1) and \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-comp-fit4)).

For most years, the SRA predicted larger abundance in the plus group (80+ *y*) than what was observed. 
A lack of fish older than 80 *y* in the survey suggested that total mortality could have been greater in the past than estimated in our OMs.
This could be represented in the OMs in two ways.
First, *M* could be increased in the models. 
However, our preliminary model investigations indicated that increasing *M* also increases retrospective bias.
Secondly, the catch history could be changed to predict higher values of fishing mortality.
This was done in OM Scenario (2) by assuming lower catches in 1986-2005, which resulted in a slightly smaller stock (Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-om)) and higher fishing mortality (Figure \@ref(fig:F-om)).
However, the estimated plus group was only slightly reduced in most years for this OM scenario (Figure \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-comp-fit2)).

This issue is a challenge for very long-lived species with poor age-composition sampling.
With such small sample sizes, there is a relatively small chance of observing very old fish.
Large structural uncertainties in the model and available data (e.g., the Dogfish survey, catch data) made it difficult to resolve one issue, e.g., persistent overprediction of old fish, without generating another issue, e.g., retrospective bias.

#### Historical trajectories {#sec:approach3-conditioning-trajectories}

In all OM scenarios, except OM Scenario (A), the median spawning biomass in 2019 is estimated to be above the LRP (Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-om)). 
OM Scenario (A) estimated median spawning biomass to have been below the LRP for most years after 2000 and less than 50% probability of being above the LRP in 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:ref-pt)).
OM Scenario (2) and OM Scenario (4) also had a small probability of being below the LRP in the current year.
Therefore, according to all the reference set OM scenarios and one robustness set OM scenario, the stock can already be considered to have rebuilt above the LRP. 
The median spawning biomass is estimated to be above the USR in OM Scenarios (1), (2), (3), and (B); and estimated to be below the USR in OM Scenarios (4) and (A).

All OM scenarios predicted a slight increase in spawning biomass during the last decade of the time series (Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-om)).
The credible interval for all OM scenarios except (A) was very broad, arising from uncertainties in natural mortality and steepness (Figure \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-parameters)).
Note that trajectories are identical for OM Scenarios (1), (3) and (B), as OM Scenarios (3) and (B) only differ from OM Scenario (1) in the treatment of parameters in the projection period.
The very narrow credible interval for OM Scenario (A) reflects the very low fixed value of *M* in this OM scenario, restricting the range of possible outcomes.

The implied spawning biomass depletion trajectories during the historical period from the eight OMs follow the same pattern as those for *B* (Figure \@ref(fig:depletion-om)).

Estimates of historical recruitment deviations were similar across OM scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:recdev-om)).

Estimated historical apical fishing mortality varied across OM scenarios, with larger values estimated for OM Scenarios (4) and (A), the more depleted trajectories (Figure \@ref(fig:F-om)).
All OM scenarios predicted large peaks in fishing mortality during the 1980s and 1990s (Figure \@ref(fig:F-om)).

## SURPLUS PRODUCTION MODEL OM SCENARIO

The 2011 stock assessment for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish applied a Bayesian state space surplus production (SP) model, fit to catch, commercial CPUE, and the HBLL and Dogfish surveys [@yamanaka2011]. 
The assessment estimated a 90% [nine times out of 10] probability that the stock was below the LRP, i.e., in the critical zone. 
The assessment results triggered a rebuilding plan [@ifmp2018], which is updated in this document.
The SRA models under all OM scenarios in the current analysis predict similar biomass trajectories to that in @yamanaka2011.
However, only OM Scenario (A) estimates the stock to have been below the LRP during the 2000s (Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-om)).

Model results diverged between the two analyses due to large differences in model structure between the SP model used in @yamanaka2011 and the SRA used here. To explore the effects of model structure on stock status, we fit a SP model to the currently-available catch, CPUE and fishery-independent indices of abundance. 
We used the SP model implemented in the R software package MSEtool [@huynh_msetool_2019], fully described in Appendix D of @anderson2020gfmp,
which was configured to resemble the 2011 assessment as much as possible, although the model used here estimated parameters using maximum likelihood.
The SP model set *B*~MSY~ to 50% of unfished biomass, set the initial biomass in 1918 to 90% of unfished biomass, and used a prior probability distribution for the intrinsic rate of population growth (*r*) as a likelihood penalty.
The prior probability distribution for *r* was normally distributed with a mean of 0.068 and standard deviation of 0.03, based on values used in @yamanaka2011.

SP model results more closely matched those of the previous assessment, estimating the stock to be below the LRP (Figure \@ref(fig:spm-biomass)).
The model estimated the reference points *B*~MSY~ = 1844 t, *F*~MSY~ = 0.03 *y*^-1^, and MSY = 62 t.
MSY and *F*~MSY~ estimates were similar to those from the SRA Base OM (Table \@ref(tab:sra-ref-pts)), but the estimate of *B*~MSY~ was approximately 35% higher for the SP model than the SRA. We note that very similar findings were made by @cox2020 in the rebuilding plan for the outside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish.
Their analysis, also based on age-structured models, predicted the current stock status for Outside Yelloweye Rockfish to be above the LRP, i.e., not in need of rebuilding, in contrast to results obtained by the SP model used in the 2014 stock assessment [@yamanaka2018yelloweyeoutside]. 

Notably, the biomass trends for the inside population since 2000 also differs between the two types of models. A flat, stable trend (below the LRP) was estimated in the SP model. On the other hand, many of the OMs developed from the SRA indicated that stock size has been increasing, although the trend is much flatter in the Low M scenario. We attempted four alternative model fits in an attempt to find scenarios that would mirror the biomass trend estimated in the SP model (Figure \@ref(fig:alt-SRA-fit)).  

First, the dogfish survey was further downweighted with a likelihood weighting factor $\lambda = 0.1$. This did not change the spawning biomass trend and the resulting stock status was more optimistic compared to the Base OM. Second, the 2019 dogfish survey value was excluded from the likelihood since the observed mean is higher than in previous recent years (with $\lambda = 4$ following the Base OM). This scenario also did not appreciably affect the spawning biomass trend and magnitude. Third, the survey age comps was downweighted with $\lambda = 0.1$. Similar to the first alternative, the spawning biomass trend was similar to the Base OM although the resultant stock status was somewhat less optimistic. Finally, the survey age comps were removed from the likelihood with $\lambda = 0$. This scenario estimated the stock to be below the LRP in concordance with the SP model. 

These results suggest that differences in estimated stock status between the current analysis and the previous stock assessment [@yamanaka2011] are in large part due to the data types included in the respective models and model structure. Both use catch and indices of abundance although the SP model leaves out the age compositions. When the two models use the same data types, i.e., excluding the age compositions from the likelihood with fixed assumptions regarding survey selectivity, both behave more similarly.

The age-structured model was chosen over the SP model to develop operating models for inside yelloweye rockfish on first principles. The age-structured model is more realistic in modeling delays in stock productivity over time. A single cohort contributes to the spawning biomass (and vulnerable biomass) over several years as it progresses through the age structure of the population. This mechanism can explain the increasing biomass estimated in the SRA. As fishing mortality decreased from catch reductions in the late 1990s into 2000, the spawning biomass started to increase. Also, the age of 5% maturity is lower than the age of 5% selectivity of the commercial fleet which would allow portions of cohorts to spawn before significant vulnerability to fishing.

For the SP model, this delay may be implicitly incorporated in the production function of the SP model but the biomass predicted in a given year is explicitly a function of the biomass observed in the previous year. Furthermore, the stock biomass in the SP model is implicitly vulnerable biomass since there are no explicit assumptions about selectivity. There is more difficulty in explaining the productivity of the stock mechanistically as all biological processes regarding growth, natural mortality, and maturity is incorporated in the intrinsic rate parameter *r*.
