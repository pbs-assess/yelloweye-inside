We ran the closed-loop simulations across 250 stochastic replicates using DLMtool version 5.4.2, `r rversion`, and the simulation random seed set to 1.
We assessed convergence of the closed-loop simulation by plotting the cumulative performance metrics as replicates were added (Figure \@ref(fig:converge)).
We deemed 250 replicates sufficient since the rank order of MPs remained consistent by this point as additional replicates were added (Figure \@ref(fig:converge)).

Assessing convergence of the closed-loop simulations on consistent rank order of MPs within performance metrics.
Colours represent individual satisficed and reference MPs.
Lines that do not cross by the final replicates indicate that rank order among replicates has converged.
Although not shown, we also checked that the satisficing rules had converged (i.e., the selection of satisficed MPs did not change with additional replicates).
We only show LRP 1.5GT and ST C10 since these were the main two performance metrics used in the satisficing step.
Although not shown, we checked the other performance metrics as well.

pm_df_list <- readRDS(here("mse/om/ye-pm-all.rds"))
pm_all <- bind_rows(pm_df_list, .id = "scenario")
pm_avg <- group_by(pm_all, MP) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
pm_min <- group_by(pm_all, MP) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric, min, na.rm = TRUE)
reference_mp <- c("FMSYref75", "NFref", "FMSYref")

satisficed_criteria <- c("LRP 1.5GT" = 0.9, "ST C10" = 0.5)
mp_sat <- dplyr::filter(pm_min, `LRP 1.5GT` > satisficed_criteria[1], `ST C10` > satisficed_criteria[2]) %>%
  pull(MP)
mp_sat <- mp_sat[!mp_sat %in% reference_mp]

pm_avg_sat <- pm_avg %>% filter(MP %in% mp_sat)
pm_min_sat <- pm_min %>% filter(MP %in% mp_sat)
```

To determine which MPs would be carried forward as satisficed MPs [@miller2010; and discussion in @anderson2020gfmp], we began by assessing average and minimum performance across all candidate MPs for the reference set of OMs (Figures \@ref(fig:tigure-avg) and \@ref(fig:tigure-min)).
All MPs met the satisficing criterion (LRP 1.5GT > 0.95) in individual OMs in the reference set and averaged across all four reference OMs (Figures \@ref(fig:tigure-avg) and \@ref(fig:tigure-min)).
Since many MPs also generated low catches, we applied an additional satisficing filter retaining only MPs where average ST C10 > 0.50.
This left us with Fixed TACs of 10 t and 15 t and Islope MPs (Figure \@ref(fig:tigure-avg)).
Applying these criteria resulted in `r gfutilities::number_to_word(length(mp_sat))` remaining MPs (`r gfutilities::commify(sort(mp_sat))`).

For the two performance metrics used in the initial satisficing step within the reference set, average LRP 1.5GT was `r round2(max(pm_avg_sat$"LRP 1.5GT"))` for all MPs and ST C10 varied between `r round2(min(pm_avg_sat$"ST C10"))` and `r round2(max(pm_avg_sat$"ST C10"))` (Figure \@ref(fig:tigure-avg) and \@ref(fig:tigure-panel)).
Minimum LRP 1.5GT was `r round2(max(pm_min_sat$"LRP 1.5GT"))` for all MPs and ST C10 varied between `r round2(min(pm_min_sat$"ST C10"))` and `r round2(max(pm_min_sat$"ST C10"))` across MPs within the reference set (Figure \@ref(fig:tigure-min) and \@ref(fig:tigure-panel)).

(ref:fig-tigure-avg) Average performance of all candidate MPs across the reference set of OMs.
MPs are ordered by decreasing performance metric values from top to bottom starting with the left-most performance metric (LT LRP) and using columns from left to right to break any ties.
The colour shading reflects the probabilities.
Outlined cells represent MPs that met a particular performance metric's satisficing criteria.
Using this set of criteria, MPs would be "satisficed" if cells in *both* "`r names(satisficed_criteria)[1]`" and "`r names(satisficed_criteria)[2]`" were outlined.
Light grey MPs indicate reference MPs.

(ref:fig-tigure-min) Minimum performance of all candidate MPs across the reference set of OMs.
This figure is the same as Figure \@ref(fig:tigure-avg) but shows the **minimum** performance metric across the OMs in the reference set for the purposes of applying satisficing rules.
In other words, this figure illustrates the worst performance of each MP across the reference set of OMs.

We focus on evaluating trade-offs among satisficed MPs in the next section. 
However, in terms of MPs that did not meet the satisficing criteria (Figure \@ref(fig:proj-not-satisficed-eg)):

- Iratio generated low catches within the first decade but generated high catches later on. There was high variability among replicates in each OM.
- IDX and IDX_smooth returned gradually lower catches over time.
- Iratio and GB_slope generated zero catch in the low catch OM; hence, they did not satisfy the ST C10 > 0.50 criteria.
- The surplus production MPs generated no or very little catch in the first decade, but increased catches later on, e.g. after 50 years.

(ref:fig-proj-not-satisficed-eg) 
Examples of MPs that were not satisficed for the OM "(1) Base". 
B/B~MSY~, F/F~MSY~, and catch are shown from the historical and projected time periods.
Dark line indicates the median value and the darker and lighter shaded ribbons indicate the 50% and 90% quantiles.
Thin gray lines represent illustrative simulation replicates.
The vertical dashed line indicates the last year of the historical period.
The horizontal dashed lines indicate B/B~MSY~ = 0.8 and 0.4 and F/F~MSY~ = 1.
