# INSIDE YELLOWEYE ROCKFISH OPERATING MODEL DEFINITION {#app:desc-om-yelloweye}

Here we demonstrate the specification of the initial OM before conditioning with the stock reduction analysis (SRA) model.
We use a convenience function `display_om()` we have written to display the contents of various parameters in the OMs.
The object `oms` is a list of the operating models across the various scenarios.
If a given "slot" or OM parameter is entered as a single value then `display_om()` outputs a single (or range) of values.
Where a range of values is displayed, this represents the lower and upper boundaries of a uniform distribution.
Where a "slot" or OM parameter is defined based on a stochastic distribution other than a uniform distribution, we demonstrate the sampling from that distribution here along with the stochastic seed used to generate consistent samples.

## STOCK SLOT DESCRIPTIONS {#app:desc-stock-yelloweye}

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### maxage {#app:desc-stock-maxage-yelloweye}

*The maximum age of individuals that is simulated.*

The maximum observed age of Inside Yelloweye Rockfish is 98 *y* [@keppel2019].
Here we set a maximum age of 80 *y*, noting that the maximum age class is treated as a plus group once the OM is conditioned by the SRA [@anderson2020gfmp].

```{r desc-stock-maxage-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "maxage")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### M {#app:desc-stock-m-yelloweye}

*Natural mortality rate.*

The rate of natural mortality *M* is a core uncertainty for this stock, as for many stocks. 
We incorporated uncertainty using a Monte Carlo approach, by sampling *M* from a prior probability distribution based on that used by @yamanaka2011, where $M \sim \textrm{Lognormal}(0.045, 0.2)$ (with the seed in R set to 91283).
This was based on the Hoenig equation [@hoenig1983] using an assumed maximum age of 101 years.
The exception was Scenario (A), which used the distribution $M \sim \textrm{Lognormal}(0.025, 0.2)$.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(91283)
OM@cpars$M <- rlnorm(nsim, log(0.045) - 0.5 * 0.2^2, 0.2)
```

```{r desc-stock-m-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo, fig.cap="Distributions of natural mortality (\\emph{M}) used in the OM scenarios. All OMs used the same distributions except \"(A) Low M\"."}
display_om(oms, "M")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### h {#app:desc-stock-h-yelloweye}

*Steepness of the stock-recruit relationship.*

Steepness (*h*) is another core uncertainty for most stocks. 
We incorporated uncertainty using a Monte Carlo approach, by sampling *h* from a prior probability distribution based on that published by @forrest2010, where $X \sim \textrm{Beta}(0.025, 0.2)$, which is then transformed to $h = 0.8 X + 0.2$. 
The values 0.025 and 0.2 were selected to give mean *h* = 0.71 and standard deviation  0.15.
<!-- We incorporated uncertainty using a Monte Carlo approach, by sampling *h* from a transformed Beta distribution such that the resulting mean was 0.71 and the resulting standard deviation was 0.12 [@forrest2010]. -->
<!-- Based on @forrest2010, the standard deviation should be approximately 0.2; however, 0.12 gave most samples between 0.5--0.9, which is a wide range of coverage, and lower values of *h* generated some samples with *F*~MSY~ < 0.01, which seemed implausible. -->

*TODO: March 23. RF cleaned up the text above but not sure what to do with the rest of this section. Was steepness transformed as written? Which chunk below is correct?*

TODO: Not sure where the 0.6375 and 0.12 come from --- whether that's just from experimentation or some analytical solution rounded. It doesn't seem to work out to 0.15... that's fine but we should note it.

TODO: see next temporary chunk; this isn't SD = 0.15 (should be h_alpha <- alphaconv(0.6375, 0.15/0.8)) etc.

TODO: Quang: Even with SD = 0.12, there were some very low values of steepness which generated FMSY < 0.01 I believe, so the smaller SD made it easier to avoid those outliers

TODO: Quang: Even the current histogram shows h samples between 0.5 - 0.9 which should be sufficient coverage

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
alphaconv <- function (m, sd) {
  m * (((m * (1 - m))/(sd^2)) - 1)
}
betaconv <- function (m, sd) {
  (1 - m) * (((m * (1 - m))/(sd^2)) - 1)
}
h_alpha <- alphaconv((0.71 - 0.2) / 0.8, 0.12)
h_beta <- betaconv((0.71 - 0.2) / 0.8, 0.12)
h_samps <- rbeta(1e6, h_alpha, h_beta)
h_samps <- 0.8 * h_samps + 0.2
mean(h_samps)
sd(h_samps)
```

TODO: ... with the seed in R set to 65423:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
alphaconv <- function(m, sd) {

}
betaconv <- function(m, sd) {

### Perr {#app:desc-stock-perr-yelloweye}

*Process error, the CV of lognormal recruitment deviations.*

We used a value of 0.4, as estimated in the base model for the Outside Yelloweye Rockfish rebuilding plan [@cox2020].
```{r desc-stock-perr-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "Perr")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Linf {#app:desc-stock-linf-yelloweye}

*Mean asymptotic length.*

This value was estimated from length and age data from the HBLL survey (see Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
This parameter was estimated for both males and females combined, as no sexual dimorphism has been observed for this stock.

```{r desc-stock-linf-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "Linf")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### K {#app:desc-stock-k-yelloweye}

*von Bertalanffy growth parameter.*


This value was estimated from length and age data from the HBLL survey (see Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
This parameter was estimated for both males and females combined, as no sexual dimorphism has been observed for this stock.


```{r desc-stock-k-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "K")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### t0 {#app:desc-stock-t0-yelloweye}

*von Bertalanffy theoretical age at length zero.*


This value was estimated from length and age data from the HBLL survey (see Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
This parameter was estimated for both males and females combined, as no sexual dimorphism has been observed for this stock.

display_om(oms, "t0")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Maturity {#app:desc-stock-maturity-yelloweye}

*Maturity ogive.*


Maturity was directly input as an age-based function.
Therefore the default DLMtool slots `L50` and `L50_95` were not used.
Female maturity-at-age was estimated using maturity and age data from the HBLL survey (Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
The minimum age observed to be mature was seven years and it assumed that younger ages were all immature.

```{r desc-stock-maturity, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
create_maturity_ogive <- function(A50, A95, maxage, Amin) {
  ages <- 1:maxage
  mat_age <- 1/(1 + exp(log(19) * (ages - A50)/(A95 - A50)))
  return(ifelse(ages < Amin, 0, Amin, mat_age))
}
OM@cpars$Mat_age <- create_maturity_ogive(14.4, 27.4, OM@maxage, 7) %>% 
  array(OM@maxage, OM@nyears + OM@proyears, OM@nsim) %>% aperm(c(3, 1, 2))
```

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### a {#app:desc-stock-a-yelloweye}

*Length-weight parameter alpha.*

This value was estimated from length and weight data from the HBLL survey (see Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
This parameter was estimated for both males and females combined, as no sexual dimorphism has been observed for this stock.

```{r desc-stock-a-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "a")
exp(display_om(oms, "a"))
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### b {#app:desc-stock-b-yelloweye}

*Length-weight parameter beta. Positive real number.*

This value was estimated from length and weight data from the HBLL survey (see Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
This parameter was estimated for both males and females combined, as no sexual dimorphism has been observed for this stock.

```{r desc-stock-b-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "b")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Fdisc {#app:desc-stock-fdisc-yelloweye}

*Fraction of discarded fish that die. Uniform distribution.*

Not used, we assumed all sources of mortality are included in the catch data.

```{r desc-stock-fdisc-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "Fdisc")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

## FLEET SLOT DESCRIPTIONS {#app:desc-fleet-yelloweye}

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### CurrentYr {#app:desc-fleet-currentyr-yelloweye}

*The current calendar year (final year) of the historical simulations ($t_c$).*

```{r desc-fleet-currentyr-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "CurrentYr")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### nyears {#app:desc-fleet-nyears-yelloweye}

*The number of years for the historical period.*

The time series of historical catch data $t_1 = 1918$ to $t_c = 2019$ was used to define the historical period of the operating model.
 
```{r desc-fleet-nyears-yelloweye, results = knitr_results, echo = knitr_echo}
display_om(oms, "nyears")
```
<!-- slot-chunk-end -->


<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Selectivity {#app:desc-fleet-selectivity-yelloweye}

Selectivities for all commercial and survey fleets were directly input as age-based logistic functions in the SRA model.
Therefore the default DLMtool slots describing selectivity-at-length were not used.

Selectivity-at-age in the HBLL survey was set to give full selectivity-at-age = 20 *y*, in all scenarios except Scenario (4), where selectivity-at-age was estimated using available age-composition data (Figure \@ref(fig:HBLL-selectivity)).
Due to large uncertainties in selectivity-at-age in the Dogfish survey, selectivity in this survey was set to mirror selectivity in the HBLL survey.

(ref:fig-HBLL-selectivity) Selectivity-at-age for the HBLL survey, which was fixed for all OM scenarios except Scenario (4). Note that selectivity in the Dogfish Survey was set to mirror the selectivity in the HBLL survey.

```{r HBLL-selectivity, fig.cap="(ref:fig-HBLL-selectivity)", out.width="6.3in"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("mse/figures/HBLL-selectivity.png"))
```

Selectivities-at-age in the recreational and commercial fleets were based on the values used in @cox2020 (Figure \@ref(fig:sra-selectivity)).
Selectivity was fixed in the SRA model, for all OM scenarios.
For the recreational fleet, the age-at-50% and 95% selectivity was 6.7 *y* and 11.5 *y*, respectively.
For the commercial hook and line fleet, the age-at-50% and 95% selectivity was 14.4 *y* and 21 *y*, respectively.

(ref:fig-sel-fleet) Selectivities-at-age used in the SRA model for the recreational and commercial fleets.

```{r sra-selectivity, fig.cap="(ref:fig-sel-fleet)", out.width="3.8in"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("mse/figures/fishery-selectivity2.png"))
```

For the projection period ($t > t_c$), the DLMtool OM only accommodates one fishing fleet.
In analyses with more than one fishing fleet, selectivity-at-age is passed from the SRA back to the DLMtool OM as an average catch-weighted selectivity function, based on normalized SRA estimates of relative fishing mortality by age and year $F_{a,y}$ (see Appendix A of @anderson2020gfmp).
The closed-loop simulation projections assume that the relative selectivities across fleets remains constant, as estimated by the SRA in the final historical year($t_c$) (Figure \@ref(fig:om-selectivity)).

(ref:fig-om-sel) Selectivity-at-age in years $t \geq t_c$ for the combined commercial and recreational fleets.

```{r om-selectivity, fig.cap="(ref:fig-om-sel)", out.width="4.5in"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("mse/figures/fishery-selectivity-terminal-year.png"))
```

## OBS SLOT DESCRIPTIONS {#app:desc-obs-yelloweye}

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### Iobs {#app:desc-obs-iobs-yelloweye}

*Observation error in the relative abundance indices expressed as a SD. Uniform distribution.*

This parameter ($\sigma_I$) sets the standard deviation in simulated survey indices for the projection period.
We set $\sigma_I = 0.25$, based on the standard deviation of the observed HBLL index for all scenarios except Scenario (B), where $\sigma_I$ was set based on the standard deviation and autocorrelation from the index residuals in Scenario (1) (see Section \@ref(sec:approach3-referenceB)).

<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### beta {#app:desc-obs-beta-yelloweye}

*A parameter controlling hyperstability/hyperdepletion where values below 1 lead to hyperstability (an index that decreases more slowly than true abundance) and values above 1 lead to hyperdepletion (an index that decreases more rapidly than true abundance). Uniform distribution*

We set the hyperstability/hyperdepletion parameter $\beta = 1$  to imply no hyperstability or hyperdepletion.

<!-- slot-chunk-end -->

## IMP SLOT DESCRIPTIONS {#app:desc-imp-yelloweye}

<!-- slot-chunk-begin -->
### TACFrac {#app:desc-imp-tacfrac-yelloweye}
