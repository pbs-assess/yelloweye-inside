# CATCH DATA {#app:catch-data}

Inside Yelloweye Rockfish is targeted in hook and line commercial fisheries, Food Social and Ceremonial (FSC) fisheries, and recreational fisheries.
Management of Inside Yelloweye Rockfish fisheries began in 1986, with the introduction of the "ZN" category commercial licence and daily bag limits for recreational fishermen.
A chronology of management changes for  commercial and recreational fisheries is shown in Tables \@ref(tab:comm-mgt-changes) and \@ref(tab:rec-mgt-changes).

## COMMERCIAL CATCH DATA {#sec:com-catch-data}

Rockfish catch data can be grouped into three time periods: historic (1918-1950), early electronic (1951--2005), and modern (2006 onwards).
There are two major sources of uncertainty in the historical and early electronic periods for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish.
The first uncertainty is that rockfish catch, other than Pacific Ocean Perch (*Sebastes alutus*), was reported as an aggregate (other rockfish, ORF) in the historic period.
To reconstruct historical catches an algorithm was developed by DFO authors [@haigh2011].
The reconstruction algorithm applies a ratio calculated from a period with credible landings data from the hook and line dockside monitoring program (1997--2005) to generate a time series of catch by species, year, fishery sector, and management area [@haigh2011].
"Credible" landings data are taken from reference years where catch knowledge was considered high quality and stable, beginning in 1997 with the start of observer trawl coverage and the individual vessel quota system [@haigh2011]. 

The second major source of uncertainty is the magnitude of unreported catch that was released or discarded at sea, prior to the introduction of 100% observer coverage in 2006.
The catch reconstruction of @haigh2011 assumes no discarding prior to 1986, when the ZN licence was instituted.
Prior to that it is assumed all rockfish were kept. Discards are assumed to be fully reported in DFO databases since 2006 and the introduction of 100% observer coverage.
Non-retained Yelloweye Rockfish catch (releases or discards) was estimated for each fishery using the ratio of Yelloweye Rockfish discarded by a fishery to fishery-specific landed targets using data from 2000--2004 hook and line observer logs.
The estimated historical unreported catch was then incorporated into the catch reconstruction, giving a final annual total.  

The commercial catch time series used in this analysis (Figure \@ref(fig:commcatch2) and Table \@ref(tab:commcatch)) differs from the one previously reported in 2009, for several reasons.
Ongoing quality control and updates to the groundfish catch database resulted in minor differences in the data over time (Maria Surry, DFO, Pacific Biological Station, pers. comm., March 9, 2020).
As well, an earlier version of the catch reconstruction algorithm was used to develop the time series for the previous stock assessment, as the final version had not yet been published.
Further refinements to the reconstruction algorithm resulted in significant changes to the estimated historical catch in some years (Norm Olsen, DFO, Pacific Biological Station, pers. comm., March 9,2020).

The reconstruction algorithm could have been applied to all years in the time series until to 2005 (after which, full at-sea and dockside monitoring came into effect).
However, for this analysis we used the reconstructed catch data from 1918--1985, and switched to the nominal catch data in 1986.
The nominal catch from 1986--2005 was then doubled,to be consistent with the previous assessment [@yamanaka2011].
We made the choice to double the nominal catch rather than the reconstructed catch because, prior to the previous assessment, advice from industry representatives indicated they did not have confidence in the catch reconstruction between 1986 and 2005, and that the scale of unreported catch was probably equal to landed catch [@dfo2012b].
As a result of this advice, the catch for these years was doubled [@yamanaka2011]. However, because discards are estimated as part of the catch reconstruction algorithm, in the current analysis we doubled the nominal catch for the period 1986--2005 (rather than the reconstructed catch), to avoid double counting of discards.
As a sensitivity check, we explore one OM scenario where the 1986--2005 commercial catches were not doubled (the "Low catch" Scenario (2), Section \@ref(sec:approach3-reference2)).

## RECREATIONAL CATCH DATA {#sec:rec-catch-data}

In 2012, DFO established a coast-wide, internet-based survey of tidal water licence holders (iRec), which collects Yelloweye data [@dfo2015].
However, the results of the survey have not been calibrated to account for uncertainties such as non-response bias. Therefore the iRec data were not included in this analysis.

### Reconstructed historical recreational catch {#sec:recon-rec-catch-data}

Historical recreational catch, prior to 1982 was reconstructed for the previous assessment based on trends in fishing effort developed through interviews with the owners of a recreational fishing resort [@yamanaka2011].
We used the same historical time series of reconstructed recreational catch for the current analysis (Table \@ref(tab:rectable)).

### Creel survey data 1982-2019 {#sec:creel-catch-data}

Annual catch of inside Yelloweye Rockfish by the recreational fishery is estimated by the Strait of Georgia (SOG) and the Northern Vancouver Island (NVI) creel surveys in all PFMAs (Figure \@ref(fig:map-4B)).
The surveys cover PFMAs 12--20, 28, and 29 [@zetterberg2010].
Rockfish catch has been recorded in areas 13--19, 28, and 29 since 1982 but was not enumerated by species until 2000.
In PFMA 12 rockfish have been counted by species since 2000, with no records prior to 2000 [@zetterberg2010].

We followed the same method as in @yamanaka2011 to estimate the recreational catch of Inside Yelloweye Rockfish from 1982 to 1999.
First, for all PFMAs other than PFMA 12, the average proportion of Yelloweye Rockfish to total rockfish catch was calculated for each PFMA in 2000 and 2001.
The average proportions were then used to derive estimates of Yelloweye Rockfish catch from the total rockfish catch by PFMA between 1982--1999.
The previous assessment assumed that the proportion of Yelloweye Rockfish catch in PFMA 12, out of the total Yelloweye catch in the SOG, would remain relatively constant over time.
Therefore, to estimate catch of Yelloweye Rockfish in PFMA 12 for the years 1982--1999, the proportion of Yelloweye Rockfish caught in PFMA 12, out of the total Yelloweye Rockfish caught in the SOG in 2000 and 2001, was calculated.
The average proportion over 2000 and 2001 was then multiplied by the total Yelloweye Rockfish catch estimated for the rest of the SOG (sum of areas 13--19, 28 and 29) to estimate Yelloweye Rockfish catch in PFMA 12 by year. (Table \@ref(tab:recbyarea)).
To be consistent with the previous assessment, an adjustment of 1.09 was applied to total annual effort to account for lack of records in PFMA 12, where effort was not recorded prior to 2000.
We converted rockfish pieces to weight by multiplying by 2.49 kg, which was the average weight of Yelloweye sampled in the creel surveys between 2000 and 2008.

We did not develop a CPUE index for the recreational fishery, despite the availability of recent creel survey data. Since the imposition of management procedures aimed at conservation of rockfishes (Table \@ref(tab:rec-mgt-changes)) there has been a shift towards active avoidance of Rockfish in recreational fisheries. As a result, there is concern that a CPUE series for the recreational fishery would not be responsive to changes in abundance and therefore could be misleading for assessment purposes.

## FOOD, SOCIAL, AND CEREMONIAL CATCH (FSC) {#sec:fsc-catch-data}

Yelloweye Rockfish are an important traditional food source for coastal First Nations in BC [@eckert2018], including in the inside waters of 4B.
Total FSC catch of Yelloweye Rockfish is not available for either the historic or contemporary time period, and the available data is not resolved to the species level (M. Fetterly, DFO Policy Treaty Support, pers. comm., November 7, 2019 and  A. Rushton, DFO South Coast Fisheries Management, pers. comm., February 7, 2020).
To account for FSC catch in the last stock assessment, @yamanaka2011 used a consumption rate (0.23 kg/year/person), which was half of the consumption rate determined in a traditional diet study from Southeast Alaska.
They applied the consumption rate to the First Nations population near area 4B to estimate total consumption over the time series (1918-2009).
This approach assumes that the consumption rate of Yelloweye Rockfish by First Nations has remained constant, despite the fact that European colonization is known to have impacted most aspects of Indigenous society over this same time period.
A decline in the amount of fish and seafood consumed by First Nations in BC has been attributed to numerous social, ecological, and economic factors; including the loss of traditional territories, diminished traditional knowledge transmission, and barriers such as poverty that makes buying boats and fishing gear unattainable for many communities [@marushka2019].
Specific to the southern part of our study area, the Coast Salish people have seen their relationship to marine resources eroded due to the development of commercial and recreational fisheries, as well as policy and political decisions [@ayers2012].
We did not, therefore, follow the methods used in @yamanaka2011.

The only FSC data that are available are from the commercial dockside monitoring program (DMP) between 2006 and 2019 (Table \@ref(tab:fsc-catch)).
These data were collected from "dual fishing" trips, which occur when indigenous fishers choose to keep some of the catch obtained during a commercial fishing trip for FSC purposes.
Both commercial and FSC catch are monitored during the offload.
Between 0 and 0.8 tonnes amounting to an average of 5.6% of the total commercial catch has been landed on dual fishing trips in this time period.
The FSC catch from these dual trips is included in the annual totals for commercial catch within the groundfish sector databases. 
The DMP catch data can only be resolved to the trip level rather than the set level, so some of the dual fishing data may be from outside of area 4B (i.e. include the catch of Outside Yelloweye). 
In order to deal with this, if more than 50% of the sets on a trip took place in 4B, we included them in the commercial catch data for 4B.
Conversely, we excluded trips that had 50% or more sets completed outside of 4B. 
Most of the dual fishing trip took place in the northern part of the study area because this is also where most of the commercial fishing for Yelloweye Rockfish in 4B currently takes place.
Indigenous fishers from the member First Nations represented by the A-Tlegay Fisheries Society, are largely obtaining Yelloweye Rockfish on dual fishing trips (C. Rusel, pers. comm., November 8, 2019).

In the southern part of the study area, indigenous fishers have little commercial capacity.
FSC catch in the Strait of Georgia is, therefore, primarily from small recreational boats (C. Ayers, pers. comm., November 7, 2019; B. Bocking, pers. comm., November 7, 2019).
Some FSC effort from small boats will be captured in the recreational data from the creel survey program.
Although FSC fishers are not constrained by recreational catch limits or closures, their boats will be counted on the aerial portion of the creel survey, and therefore contribute to the expanded recreational catch estimates.
The proportion of FSC fishers encountered by the dockside creel monitor was not, however, readily available in the recreational database (CREST) (P. Zetterberg, DFO, pers. comm., November 29, 2019).

As we have shown, there are limited information available to assist with quantifying FSC catch of Inside Yelloweye Rockfish. Without more detailed information it is not possible to reliably estimate any impact of FSC catch on the results of this analysis. Greater collarboration with First Nations could help address some of these data issues, and should be a priority for future analyses.
